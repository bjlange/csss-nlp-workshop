Dive into the world of Natural Language Processing with the power of Python and its many analysis libraries. 
We'll use NLTK, TextBlob, and more on real text data, learning about stemming, word counts, sentiment analysis, 
and ways to summarize bodies of text. We'll also talk a little about some of the more advanced techniques 
available today, like text extraction, topic modeling, and machine learning techniques.
