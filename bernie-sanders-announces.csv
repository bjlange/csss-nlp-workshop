Xelif,68,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Nah, the campaign regulations kick in now, once you pre-announce. (Basically, it's whenever you start acting like a candidate; several of the ""totally *not* a candidate^y^e^t "" candidates have pending FEC complains against them by public advocacy groups for acting as candidates for all intents and purposes, but not playing by the candidate finance rules.) 

Plus, it's not like he's gobbling up hundreds of millions of corporate dollars into a SuperPAC network, which is the main reason why so few known candidates have announced.

They pre-announce before the announcement to build hype, basically. Like, presumably he'll have a speech or something somewhere, and the people in that location need to know so they can pack the hall and give standing ovations, and the press need to know so they can cover it. Logistical reasons."

I board last and pack plenty of tasty treats for the crew. Every once in a great while,  those vittles get me a big seat,  and sometimes I get sat with interesting people.  

My favorite was an Army General (active) out of Austin. As we landed, he turned to me and said, ""Wait for it... There they go... If your calls can't wait son, they don't respect you.  When your calls *really* can't wait, you won't be sitting next to me. If you'll take that call, email me.""

blargh12312312312312,3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"As an American, I'm for Sanders. However, as demonstrated by Obama, the President has very limited powers. To fix things we'd need to gut the house and senate and replace most of them with ""good"" politicians like Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. But this simply isn't going to happen. Gerrymandering, political differences, only having two viable parties, citizens united, etc, make this a very long-term prospect. 

As much as I hate to say it, Americans tend to alternate between parties for president. We'll likely end up with a nutcase republican president and eventually a democrat-controlled senate and/or house. And then in 4, 6, or 8 years it'll switch again. Either way, we'll make limited progress over long stretches of time with occasional back-slides in important contentious areas like human rights, personal liberties, social safety nets, military actions, foreign policy, etc. 

It sucks, but it seems to be the way things are. I personally feel like a lot of poor and middle-class republicans are blind to the damage they're doing to themselves. I'm sure they feel like I'm blind to something as well. And the cycle continues."

* Rated F by the NRA, indicating a pro-gun control voting record. (Dec 2003) Is this just the NRA being stupid?

I don't know enough about about these specifically, but trade seems like a good thing. Is it because of something he doesn't agree with that's going on in these countries?

""Free trade agreements"" are just names. They are trade agreements, not ""free trade agreements."" I'm assuming you're talking about the TPP, to which Bernie is opposed primarily because it's being developed in secret and fast-track is being attempted to bypass the legislative process before anyone knows the contents.

http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file

&gt;The TPP follows in the footsteps of other unfettered free trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA and the
Permanent Normalized Trade Agreement with China (PNTR). These treaties have forced American workers to
compete against desperate and low-wage labor around the world. The result has been massive job losses in the
United States and the shutting down of tens of thousands of factories. These corporately backed trade
agreements have significantly contributed to the race to the bottom, the collapse of the American middle class
and increased wealth and income inequality. The TPP is more of the same, but even worse.

&gt;10 Ways that TPP would hurt Working Families

&gt;1. TPP will allow corporations to outsource even more jobs overseas.

&gt;2. U.S. sovereignty will be undermined by giving corporations the right to challenge our laws before international tribunals.

&gt;3. Wages, benefits, and collective bargaining will be threatened.

&gt;4. Our ability to protect the environment will be undermined.

&gt;5. Food Safety Standards will be threatened.

&gt;6. Buy America laws could come to an end.

&gt;7. Prescription drug prices will increase, access to life saving drugs will decrease, and the profits of drug companies will go up

&gt;8. Wall Street would benefit at the expense of everyone else.

&gt;9. The TPP would reward authoritarian regimes like Vietnam that systematically violate human rights.

&gt;10. The TPP has no expiration date, making it virtually impossible to repeal.

The actual link has the full details of each point.

Looks like the Amber Alert question was answered.

&gt;Vote on passage of a bill to implement unfinished recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission) to fight the war on terror more effectively:

&gt;I: Improving Intelligence and Information Sharing within the Federal Government and with State, Local, and Tribal Governments

&gt;II: Homeland Security Grants

&gt;III: Communications Operability and Interoperability

&gt;IV: Emergency Management Performance Grants Program

&gt;V: Enhancing Security of International Travel

&gt;VI: Privacy and Civil Liberties Matters

&gt;VII: Enhanced Defenses Against Weapons of Mass Destruction

&gt;VIII: Private Sector Preparedness

&gt;IX: Transportation Security Planning and Information Sharing

&gt;X: Incident Command System

&gt;XI: Critical Infrastructure Protection

&gt;XII: Congressional Oversight of Intelligence

&gt;XIII: International Cooperation on Antiterrorism Technologies

&gt;XIV: Transportation and Interoperable Communication

&gt;XV: Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention

&gt;XVII: 911 Modernization

&gt;XIX: Advancement of Democratic Values

&gt;Opponents recommend voting NO because:

&gt;One of the authors of the 9/11 Commission report said, the President's announced strategy should be given a chance to succeed. That is what I think we should do, give this plan a chance to succeed. Our troops in theater, our commanders, and the Iraqi leaders all believe they can see early signs of success in this program, even though it has just begun, and they are cautiously optimistic that it can succeed. I think it would be unconscionable for the Congress, seeing the beginnings of success here, to then act in any way that would pull the rug out from under our troops and make it impossible for them to achieve their mission.

The reason seems to be that the 2004 Act and the 2007 Act are significantly different. I couldn't find the specific reason that caused him to vote the way he did."

neurosisxeno,64,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"The NRA also factors in Political Affiliation.  Democrats almost universally have lower ratings than Republicans, regardless of voting records.  I can't remember a Democrat that didn't get the F Rating from the NRA.

EDIT:  There ranking is based on a survey and past voting record.  Basically the NRA also adds their own ""opinion"" which means if they don't like Democrats they can give them bad ratings no matter what their *actual* stance is.  I believe they have time and time again said Obama was trying to kill peoples right to bear arms despite him never even advocating for Gun Control, let alone agreeing to sign it into law."

I think that this has more to do with them leveraging fear of the big, bad democrat in office taking people's guns away so that gun makers can sell more guns to panicked idiots than any genuine belief on their part that he's going to do these things.

Sirisian,4,U.S. Sen.

Also second amendment reasoning that laws shouldn't needlessly limit or delay a person's ability to arm themselves. Also gun background checks are instant so as long as the database is correct it should theoretically stop someone from getting a gun that shouldn't have one by law.

Playing devil's advocate to myself. It's possible that filing the paperwork is slow so a 5 day wait might work if the person is released then immediately goes to acquire a gun and passes the background check. I have no idea if that's a realistic scenario. Can't find much about the process. I have to assume it's standardized so that such data would be done before the person the person is released, but I'm not sure that's true."

LetsGetMotarded,6,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It's a double-edged sword that can also theoretically prevent someone from protecting themselves in the event of something like an abusive ex.  

Realistically, if someone is so bent-up about something that they are going to go on a shooting spree, they can probably circumvent the law, and considering they are about to go on a shooting spree they aren't probably to bothered by the fact that their actions are illegal.

The other side would be someone in a situation where they are facing a threat of imminent violence, and wanting to protect themselves.  Do they risk becoming a criminal to do so?

It's the argument you run up against with a lot of the controversial gun control measures.  Their impact on crime would probably be minimal short of outright banning guns (which isn't happening) and is more likely to negatively impact otherwise law-abiding citizens than it is to deter a criminal already set on breaking the law anyway."
alanevwes,3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It's not a double-edged sword. The police is supposed to protect you from an abusive ex. Guns aren't there to protect yourself they're there for fun. 

Being bent up doesn't last 3 days in most cases. If you plan on going on a shooting spree, or maybe we should include just murdering 1 person, then in 3 days time you have enough time to think of the legal implications it will have. 

You also imply that people always think about the law if they are planning on doing something illegal. People don't make calculated rational decisions. Have you ever thought about the legal risks when you don't stop at a stop sign, drive too fast, smoke weed, throw a wrapper on the street, spit out gum, punch someone or cross the street diagonally? 

Circumventing the law is also harder than it sounds. Do you know how to obtain a gun illegally right now? Not some hypothetical stuff like going to the harbour and asking people if you can buy a gun but a real scenario you could actually carry out right now.  

Every measure that tries to keep guns out of the hands of criminals does work. The prices of a gun will go up and the ways to obtain a gun go down for criminals. Especially in the US where you can only get guns that were previously sold in a gun store since US borders are mostly water or well protected.

People don't abide the law because they are scared of it. If they would all people would be psychopaths. People abide the law because they can relate to the consequences it would have on safety or other people. Criminals put themselves before others to a certain extent but that doesn't mean they stopped caring about other people. Breaking the law by stealing food from a store doesn't mean you are equally comfortable with killing and raping. "
PillsberryDboy4,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"One of the main reasons people have firearms is for protection, the police can't be everywhere. "
LetsGetMotarded,3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"To address a few of your points:

&gt;It's not a double-edged sword. The police is supposed to protect you from an abusive ex. 

[Except they're not required to.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales)

The Police can't park an officer near every person with a restraining order 24/7.  At some point the defense of yourself becomes at least partially your responsibility until we have 24/7 instant police coverage, which I find a scarier thought than everyone having a gun to be honest.

&gt;Guns aren't there to protect yourself they're there for fun.

Incorrect according to the constitution and Supreme Court.  Given that there are Supreme Court Cases decided to the contrary such as [DC v Heller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Amicus_curiae_briefs) wherein the ruling even states:
&gt;(1) The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, **such as self-defense** within the home. Pp. 2–53.

&gt; Circumventing the law is also harder than it sounds. Do you know how to obtain a gun illegally right now? Not some hypothetical stuff like going to the harbour and asking people if you can buy a gun but a real scenario you could actually carry out right now.

Given that I already own six guns I suppose it's not necessary, but yes.  Were I prohibited possessor or in need of a firearm without a BGC I could call a few friends and probably get my paws on a gun without any paperwork.  Seeing as I'm not the kind of person to go around shooting people or with connections to a criminal network, I'd assume it'd be easier if I were a less honest human being.

AML86,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt; The police is supposed to protect you

The Supreme court ruled that police have no duty to protect people. http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/28scotus.html

It's already known that police response times are too slow to expect protection anyway. In the US you have a duty to yourself to keep safe and protect yourself from harm. If that means using a gun, then that option should be available to you, per the 2nd Amendment. Other countries may disagree with this, but that's how US law is tailored.

I find that court ruling troubling, but understandable. Police can't protect everyone.

&gt;Guns aren't there to protect yourself they're there for fun. 

This also isn't how US law sees firearms. In a country like the UK, they are for sporting purposes, but in the US they have been self-defense weapons since the country's founding."
LiquidAether,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Right, it's not going to do anything to protect against premeditated acts of violence, only examples such as someone getting in an argument and going to buy a gun to settle it.

If someone is fearing for imminent violence, they're expected to seek protection from the police.

Obviously there are exceptions, but the idea is to cover the broadest possible cases.  I don't know how successful it's been in that regard."

Shotguns on the other hand, are big, bulky, and obvious.  Much more likely to get the police called on you or just make the person flee.  This is why handguns are the source of the vast majority of homicides.

I think the idea has merit, and makes sense.  However, I would have to do research to decide if it actually works as intended.  I simply don't know myself."

1.) Approved for purchase  
2.) Rejected (prohibited person)  
3.) Hold for further informaton.  

3 will usually happen if someone has a name similar to a prohibited possessor.  I believe the ATF has to give a approve/deny within a set time frame in this case or it is de facto approved. 

The 3-day waiting period is usually referred to as a ""cooling off"" period with the theory being that someone buying a gun to shoot up a post office might change their mind in those three days."

Have you ever seen the video of the police officer with a pistol being gunned down by the Vietnam vet? It's worth a google. That's a real-life situation where even a pistol with an unrestricted magazine wasn't enough. If you have a pistol and the other guy has a rifle, you need every shot you can get. Arbitrarily limiting magazine size to 10 rounds just doesn't make sense, because it's crippling your ability to defend yourself just so some people who have no idea what they're going on about can feel like they accomplished something.

This is wrong. The continuation of this claim is setting back productive conversations regarding the TPP.

Trade negotiations are always conducted in secret. It is simply not possible to let 12 different legislatures negotiate. Furthermore, the power to negotiate lies with the Executive Branch as outlined in the U.S. Constitution.

The contents will absolutely be known by the legislature before the deal is passed. Fast Track simply makes it a yes/no vote, since any amendment would have to go through the 11 other countries, and delay the agreement (likely indefinitely) as everyone tries once again to get on the same page."
Moocat87,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt; **Trade negotiations are always conducted in secret.**

This is wrong. A claim that ""X is always Y"" can be refuted with 1 anecdote. See 3 FTAA drafts, irrefutable proof of trade agreement negotiations not conducted in secret:

&gt;http://www.ftaa-alca.org/ftaadrafts_e.asp

Fast track is what grants the president the power to negotiate and sign before presenting to congress. Fast track has been in place 1975-1994, 2002-2007. Any trade agreements outside this timeframe would not fall under the same executive branch powers. 

&gt; The fast track negotiating authority for trade agreements is the authority of the President of the United States to negotiate international agreements that Congress can approve or disapprove but cannot amend or filibuster. Also called trade promotion authority (TPA) since 2002, fast track negotiating authority is a temporary and controversial power granted to the President by Congress. The authority was in effect from 1975 to 1994, pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974, and from 2002 to 2007 by the Trade Act of 2002. Although it expired for new agreements on July 1, 2007, it continued to apply to agreements already under negotiation until they were eventually passed into law in 2011. In 2012, the Obama administration began seeking renewal of the authority.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_track_%28trade%29

&gt; It is simply not possible to let 12 different legislatures negotiate. 

Secrecy doesn't mean preventing them from negotiating, it means preventing them from *knowing* what is being negotiated. Secrecy has *nothing* to do with negotiation and you're conflating the two, seemingly on purpose. You might acknowledge that large corporations and lobbyists have had access to the text and have participated in the negotiations from the beginning, while our congress has not."

These are Checked bags. This is no different than placing a gun into a checked bag on an airplane. In-fact many photographers put guns in their expensive equipment cases so that the case is handled with better care when flying on an airplane (prevent damaged items).

Additionally, many people would just carry the weapon on board with them in a bag as there is no metal detection or x-ray when boarding a train.

Plain gun control.

&gt;  Voted YES on prohibiting product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers. (Oct 2005)

Its not a manufacturers fault if you mis-used the product. Its like eating rat poison and then suing the poison company.

&gt;  Voted YES on prohibiting suing gunmakers &amp; sellers for gun misuse. (Apr 2003)

Its not a sellers fault if you mis-used the product.

On a full size Glock 17 it's 17. We're not talking ridiculous 100 round drum magazines hanging off the gun here, just the standard size."
mountainroad,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Need does not enter into it. It is a bill of rights, not a bill of needs. 

If you insist on asking the question, despite it missing the point, I would submit that the effectiveness of most modern medium caliber weapons is based at least somewhat on magazine capacity. I possess firearms for a variety of reasons but the right to posses them largely exists because the founders intended that right as the peoples ""liberty teeth"". Limiting the effectiveness of civilian owned firearms through reduced magazine capacities etc. is unacceptable in my mind. 

Edit: On a friendly note, that question, ""why do you NEED that?!"" is a question gun enthusiasts and 2A supporters often ask each other ironically because its been asked and answered about a million times, when you asked it I was typing up something snarky and sarcastic in response but realized you might actually be serious.

tdlop,-3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"No, I get your point. My point is that there's no real use for it. If you can't hit your target with 10 rounds, you're probably not going to hit it anyway. And if by ""liberty teeth"" you're talking about defending yourself against the government, be realistic. You're never going to win against the US military.

For the record, I'm against that kind of ban, just because there's no real reason for it. It's just more near the bottom of my priority list, and it's not going to keep me from voting for somebody who's otherwise really good. Obviously it's a lot more important for you, which is good, because it is important and somebody does needs to fight for it."
ten24,4,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt; My point is that there's no real use for it. If you can't hit your target with 10 rounds, you're probably not going to hit it anyway. 

1. Some guns don't have magazines in existence under 10 rounds.  A large number of handguns have factory magazines that are 13-17 rounds.  To ban magazines over 10 rounds, amounts to a ban on replacement and repair parts for these guns... even if they're generous enough to grant a grandfather clause.

2. You could say the same thing about all kinds of recreational sports, but legislating sports by law is kind of silly.   I like to shoot for a couple minutes before I have to reload.  Breaking my concentration every 20 seconds gets old.  *By all means, go after the criminals*, but please leave me alone.

&gt;And if by ""liberty teeth"" you're talking about defending yourself against the government, be realistic. You're never going to win against the US military.

Personally I find this to be an uncomfortable concept, but if anything,  it's a deterrent, not an all encompassing preventative measure."

Bear_Manly,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"The banning of high cap mags just shows that he doesnt look at the big picture and voted more on emotion than logic. There is no correlation between high cap magazines and gun crime. His reasoning was that they have been used in mass shootings. Which is an absolutely miniscule amount of the gun crime percentage. Overall i agree with most of his votes on gun rights, but that one vote bothers me. Shows there is some misinformation on gun crime, which is worrisome to me."
xiccit,3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,If you can't take down your target in 10 rounds maybe you shouldn't be shooting at something.. or just keep a second mag on hand.
Bear_Manly,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt;or just keep a second mag on hand.

Exactly the reason why these bans are retarded. Also though, the high cap magazines are nice for target shooting so you dont have to stop to completely fill a mag every other minute. People also hunt feral hogs which might need a couple shots, and they usually try to kill as many as they can because they are so damn destructive.

I just have always wanted to vote for someone who actually represents my political ideology. Now I have the chance to do that. Read through his agenda. See if it agrees with you. "
nixonrichard,8,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Personally I don't care too much for Republican vs. Democrat.  You have classic liberals and libertarian republicans vs. authoritarian liberals and authoritarian conservatives.

Sanders is a classic liberal, and I really like that.  I also think there are good Republicans out there.  Lisa Murkowski is starting to stand out as a pretty good future Presidential candidate too.

I pretty much support any candidate who fights for individual rights.  Hillary is the exact antithesis of this.  She's a person who fought for an unconstitutional video game ban and for the Iraq War and wants to ban the most popular rifle in the nation, and she does all of this with a smug sense of superiority over ordinary people.

WAR_T0RN1226,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,How is Bernie Sanders on basic 2nd amendment rights?
PureOhms,4,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Sanders is a mixed bag. He's voted in support of an NRA sponsored bill to prevent lawsuits against gun manufacturers for misuse of their guns by people who bought them, voted against the Brady bill, and voted to allow people to carry firearms in their checked baggage on Amtrak trains. But he's also for expanded background checks for people purchasing firearms and for restricting purchase of high-capacity magazines. 

Generally it seems that he believes people should have the right to own firearms, and that gun control should be left to the states, but some of his support of federal gun control measures seems to be aligned with reducing mass shootings (bans on high-capacity mags in particular). Specifically he's said that mass shooting are an issue with our lack of attention to mental health issues, but that some gun control is a stopgap measure essentially. 

Edit: He's rated F by the NRA, but if you actually look at his voting record that grade seems to be based on his political beliefs e.g. democratic socialism, and not based on his voting for gun control. "
nixonrichard,-1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"He also voted for the most recent (single feature) assault weapons ban, which would have banned a lot of very common firearms (including the most popular rifle in America).

I'd say, on the whole, he's pretty weak on protecting 2nd amendment rights."
nixonrichard,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Not great.

He voted for the most recent (very strict) assault weapons ban, so I'd say he's pretty close to Hillary on guns, although he has a mixed voting record on guns.

Bernie has been doing this for a loooong time. He has been unwavering in his political positions. Unless there is some nefarious force pushing presidents to renege on their beliefs, I don't see him being as disappointing as Obama was.

And besides, I don't expect Bernie to change the world. A president has little power domestically. I do expect him to fight for a leftist foothold, instead of rolling over as Obama has done. "
tasmanian101,7,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Obama has promised a lot of hopes and dreams, mainly through things he hoped would happen, and he tried pretty damn hard, within his power, to attain those. Obama just hoped for a lot of things not within his direct power, and as a skilled politician he knows where his sphere of influence ends and burned bridges begin. Obama made a ton of suggestions, and only was able to follow through on a few of them, eg Guantanamo vs obamacare."
nixonrichard,8,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I don't think that's quite an accurate representation.  When it came to REALLY big issues like open and transparent government (which Obama made a cornerstone of his campaign) Obama had nearly unlimited unilateral power, and rather than increasing open and transparent government, he made it worse.  He shut out the press, prosecuted leaks, intimidated journalists, and denied FOIA requests at an alarming (and record-setting) rate.

Obama promised to broadcast healthcare negotiations on CSPAN.  He didn't need anyone's approval for that (well, except maybe CSPAN) he just didn't do it.  He promised a waiting period for public comment on legislation.  Again, nobody could stop him from keeping this promise . . . he just didn't do it.

Simple things like recognizing the Armenian Genocide . . . particularly considering the recent anniversary . . . are really disappointing areas where Obama could have EASILY kept a promise, and instead chose to break it.  Promises on tax form reform, where all it would take is a simple change of IRS policy . . . no go.  Ending no-bid contracts?  That's as easy as an executive order . . . but it didn't happen.  Allow importing prescription drugs?  That's perhaps one of the saddest broken promises.  Obama's administration actually lobbied AGAINST this law when it was proposed by John McCain (who also made it a campaign promise)."

Obama looked like he might actually be able to beat McCain so some of us voted for Clinton in an effort to make the democrat selection worse than what it could have been. It didn't work then, clearly. It would be very easy for news stations like FOX to link Bernie's stance as a democratic socialist to full blown communist as most people would not bother to look up what the difference was. Hilary is a recognizable person compared to any Republican, currently Sanders is not. We are not concerned he will challenge us as it is easy to ruin a candidates image to the general people.

hai-faiv,3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I think it's from this. A paid appearance to speak at UCLA. Not actually a campaign donation.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/27/hillary-clinton-paid-300000-and-bill-clinton-got-250000-for-ucla-speeches/

&gt;Former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton was paid $300,000 to speak to students and faculty at the University of California Los Angeles in March, the university confirmed Friday.

&gt;UCLA spokesman Jean-Paul Renaud said Clinton's fee was paid through a private endowment established for a lecture series by Meyer Luskin, an investor and president of Scope Industries, a food waste recycling company.

&gt;In 2012, former president Bill Clinton was paid $250,000 to deliver the inaugural address in the Luskin lecture series, Renaud said.

&gt;In both instances, Renaud said, the Clintons' fees went to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

&gt;""It came from private money,"" Renaud said. Although UCLA is a public university, he added, ""No public funds were used for it -- no tuition dollars, no state funds."""

Remember that a huge amount of people respected Ron Paul for his honest and principled stances, even if a lot of us didn't agree with his general right-wing platform.

Starslip,4,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I was actually thinking the same exact thing before reading your comment. We criticize politicians for proceeding bullheadedly along a certain trajectory long after it's become apparent it was a bad idea, yet we call them flip floppers and wishy washy if they change their minds later.

At the same time, a war is a pretty big thing to change your mind on. I mean, it's a good indicator you probably didn't have all the facts when you jumped into it, which isn't something you want to hear from someone in a leadership position regarding something as serious as war.

Also, how you present your change of mind also matters. If you say you were mistaken or new information had made you revise your opinion, then that's reasonable and you'd hope a president would be willing to do that. But if you just suddenly start being against something you were previously for without any comment on it, it makes it seem like you're just going with whatever public opinion is at the time, or whatever is politically expedient, and hoping that people will forget about your previous position. Hillary seems more like the latter than the former."

It's clear she was totally on board with the effort. On the other hand the extent of her disavowal of the Iraq War, as far as I can tell, amounts to a couple lines in a book she published recently. Even during the 2008 campaign, she refused to apologize for it. She's never given a detailed speech or explanation for why it was a mistake, and what led her to advocate for it."

In the end, the policies of last 35 years or so have rewarded companies for sending jobs overseas where people get paid 25 cents an hour making it impossible for Americans to compete.  They have eliminated taxes that almost every country uses to equalize trade--yes making products cheaper but in the end only crushing the middle class in this country.  American used to make stuff.  When we made stuff, people had good jobs, and, our products were sold around the world.  60,000 factories closed in the last 15 years.  Think about that-- how many jobs etc.  All so the CEOs of companies like Walmart can eek out a few extra billion in profit in a year- all while not paying taxes like they should.

&gt;Why is Sanders a ""way better choice"" than Clinton? I ask sincerely. I want to be informed.

If you believe in the equal and fair treatment and payment of employees and all people, and having social services to improve health care, welfare, and education, that is what Sanders is all about.

If you support stuff like the TPP, big business, and stuff to move jobs out of the US to save money, and allow big businesses to have even more advantages over average people, go for Hillary."

if no one sees that and he just gets labeled as a crazy socialist, his ""ability to unite"" doesn't matter, he won't get elected. he's doing his own thing without being compromised by money, which is why he appeals to many.

Hilldog will basically be big corporate republican, but she won't try to destroy education and social services.  Basically she won't just attack the middle and low class outright, but she simply don't do anything to help them either.

To me, the whole ISIS debacle sounds similar to what McCain was hinting at, roughly.  Doesn't change the fact that it was a ridiculous statement at its core, and that prolonging an unpopular war is not a topic you want to exaggerate about when running for president. "
Kamkazev2,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I agree that us pulling out was bound to fuck things up. To me, that strengthens the argument that we should stay out of other people's business in the future, not strengthen our position as the world police, as McCain argued for. ISIS was inevitable without a strong figure in charge. Look at Africa, it is the same shit.

I'd rather let those countries figure it out on their own than kill Americans. Or we could drone, but for some reason we hate that idea. Regardless, I am much happier with Obama than McCain. I agree Obama is not perfect but considering the political climate, he has done a good job."

But:

* Most of the Republican field is politicians who appeal to Republican faithful, not the general electorate.
* The few candidates who might appeal to the general electorate will come under attack from the right (Bush, Christie), don't have much to distinguish themselves from the pack (Rubio), have the wrong name (Bush), have a scandal brewing (Christie), and are polling in the low teens (Bush, Rubio) or low single digits (Christie).
* The Republican primary cycle is going to be a *nasty* fight. Whomever wins isn't going to come out unscathed.
* The electorate seems to associate Republicans more closely than Democrats with problems in Congress; Congress has been on a multi-year campaign to see if they can break math and get a negative approval rating.
* If Hillary is anointed and crowned without a fight, not only do we get (quite frankly) a two-faced self-serving candidate who's bought and paid for by Wall Street robber barons, the general public will be quite tired of her by the time the election rolls around.
* The hardcore Republican base, ill-informed and reactionary though they may be, get up and fight for their beliefs during primary season. Why shouldn't the hardcore Democratic base do the same? Why should we simply accept the designated candidate foisted upon us by party elders?"

This guy is the real deal, someone who actually gives a crap about everyday people and the good of the country. Yeah we kinda got that feeling from Obama but Sanders has decades of walk behind his talk. I was satisfied with Obama's nomination, but I am excited about Bernie running.

* Got African-Americans the right to vote  
* Created Social Security, lifting millions of elderly out of poverty  
* Ended segregation  
* Passed the civil-rights act  
* Created medicare

My biggest issues with Hilary is that she is a huge proponent of the financial sector and I can't see her ever pushing any legislation with teeth on banking, I also don't see her doing anything about domestic spying.  Lastly, she will likely continue Obama's push for more trade agreements, which just continue to siphon jobs outside of the US. 

She is alright on social issues, but to me it seems most of that will be decided by individual states and/or the supreme court.

However if Hilary wins you have to vote what you think is best for the country, and there is no logic that says to me that voting for anyone other than Hilary in that situation is a good choice.  A third party can't win, so unless your state isn't close you really should pick the lesser of two evils, that is the correct thing to do.

kanst,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"If you really thing both candidate are that terrible, go in, vote for some local stuff and just leave the president option blank.

If people don't show up because the candidates don't align with you then they will never align with you.  Candidates will only shift left when it is NECESSARY for them to win an election.  That is why the Republican party has shifted further right, because the Tea party made that move imperative. 

Whether you can vote for Hilary really depends on what issues you consider important.  For me personally, Jeb Bush and Hilary will be basically the same on finance, domestic spying, war on drugs, police militarization.  However Hilary will be better for Gay Rights, women's reproductive rights, and probably a little less war hawkish (though she is a bit of a hawk), those issues do matter to me so that is enough for me to bite my tongue and vote for her if it comes down to it.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/03/28/rand-paul-gay-marriage-debate-a-moral-crisis/

Also, he generally supports leaving LGBT issues to the states, which ultimately allows them to ban gay marriage and discriminate at will, so not a big fan of that.

Oh, and he now wants to up defense spending a huge amount. 
http://time.com/3759378/rand-paul-defense-spending/

In summary, no thanks to Rand Paul."
skeptix,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Please differentiate between civil libertarians (like myself) and minarchists, anarcho capitalists and the like.

I'm with you on abortion, but he would not be successful in pushing his regretful views on this matter.  So it is a non-starter for me.

He does support decriminalization, which is a step in the right direction, and more than can be said of Hillary.

He is absolutely not pro-religion in government.  He has issues with gay marriage, but he takes the classic libertarian view of leaving it to the states.

I want equality just as much as you, I just don't want it to be the result of government enforcement if organic social change can accomplish the same goal (and I think it can).

The defense spending is a rather transparent attempt to make himself a legitimate candidate within the party.  He very much takes after his father on issues of intervening in other countries affairs.

I'm not saying he's great, I'm just saying he's better than Hillary, which isn't saying all that much."
imnotsoclever,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Again, I'm not a libertarian... at all.

I support universal healthcare, welfare programs, high minimum wage, strict financial regulations, environmental protections, higher taxes on the rich and corporations, etc. I'm perfectly happy for ""government enforcement"" being used to cure deep, systemic inequalities (see: the Civil Rights Act). 

None of those things fall under even basic libertarianism. I'd take a corporate-backed centrist over an ideological libertarian any day of the week. It's not even close in my mind.

One thing though... regarding religion in government... really? Because Rand himself said exactly the opposite: http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/03/30/rand-paul-the-first-amendmentdoesnt-say-keep-religion-out-of-government/

Edit: Not only that, but he doesn't believe in man made climate change. So, seriously, screw Rand Paul. http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/204235-paul-science-behind-climate-change-not-conclusive

I don't think I'd like him very much as a person, but I'll take his policies over Clinton's.  If you really understood them, and Clinton's, I'd hope you would feel the same, because otherwise your shooting yourself in the foot.

You should know that libertarianism is not so easily defined.  I am a *civil libertarian*.  This just means I think the government should stay out of our personal lives (with the line being drawn at the direct victimization of others).  I also support universal healthcare, a smart social safety net, tax incentives to promote higher wages, removal of corporate personhood (so laws can be put on the books as opposed to regulation), laws to protect the environment, and a fair tax system that removes current loopholes.

The civil rights act is outdated and rather unnecessary at this point.  It was needed then, but it isn't now.  There are deep systematic inequalities, but they are largely in our laws and enforcement.  I think the #1 step towards removing these inequalities is to end the drug war, which only libertarians talk about doing.

You should really reconsider your position on at least my brand of libertarianism."
imnotsoclever,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It's funny you claim I don't understand his policies (or Clinton's), yet you seem to ignore all evidence that Rand Paul is a really poor civil libertarian.

Is this not his policy on abortion? http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/rand-paul-government-should-play-a-role-in-restricting-abortion-20150416

His policy on gay marriage? Leaving it to the states? I think allowing 20 or so states to ban gay marriage kind of goes against the notion of ""staying out of people's personal lives"".

He literally said the debate on gay marriage is part of a American moral crisis. Sure, let's stay out of people's lives but I'm going judge them for not following my own religious brand of morality. Oh, but it's just his personal beliefs, I should just trust that his policies will go against what he says and thinks.

Also, regarding libertarianism, I don't care what YOU are, I care what HE is. You seem to be missing the biggest point which is that he is a libertarian. I don't care what what brand of libertarian you are, I AM NOT A LIBERTARIAN, nor will I ever be a libertarian. He believes in a limited role for government, which is the exact opposite of my beliefs. He wants to dismantle the EPA. He wants to repeal Obamacare. He wants to be more hawkish on Iran. He wants to leave gay marriage and gay rights to the state. He wants less restrictive gun control. Guess who doesn't want to do anything of those things? Hillary Clinton.

I understand the issues just fine, I just don't believe in your ideology. You can tell me that my beliefs are wrong, which is fine, but don't try to tell me that Rand Paul is an alternative to Hillary Clinton.

I also think it's hilarious that you're trying to sell Rand Paul in a post about Bernie Sanders."

JoshuaZ1,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,Then it doesn't matter. Carry on then. If you were in a swing state I'd suggest you find a friend in a blue state and agree that you vote for Hillary and the friend vote third party. But since you are in a blue state it doesn't matter. 
philip1201,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Does that make sense in the long term? Voting in an entrenched blue states doesn't do anything but send a message (as if the politicians don't know the public hates them), but while the Democrats might lose if people vote in a swing state, that sends a clear message that they lost *because they failed to appeal to the independents*."
JoshuaZ1,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It depends precisely what ones goals are and what your priorities are.

For a third party, having votes in those other states helps a lot though: first, in many states, what fraction of the total vote a party gets can influence how the state treats them for balloting purposes, whether their candidates get to be in debates for state and local level positions, and whether people take their candidates seriously at a state and local level. If a third party gets 10% of the vote in a state at the Presidential election, that's a massive credibility boost for them when it comes to the internal elections the next time.

Also, if a blue state starts looking purplish because of people voting third party, the Democrats will notice and respond well before they lose the state. (Same remark goes for Republicans with a Red state looking more purple).

So if you want the Democratic candidate to win and still want to effectively help a third party, this helps accomplish both goals.

cosmickramer,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"The fundamental difference between the way that we're talking is that I'm talking about parties and you're talking about candidates. If Sanders runs as a democrat, a vote for him is a vote for democrats. Same for Hilary. Say Sanders or someone with similar views runs as independent. So you have Hilary, Sanders and a Republican. With the money machine behind both Hilary and Republicans (for better or worse) it means, one of the two will win. This is unfortunate but the truth. So voting for Sanders splits the left wing vote and the Republicans have a much easier time winning the electoral college. 

I understand your position and your frustration. I wish it was not this way. But if you want to change the system, you need a movement - the Tea Party and the midterm elections in 2010 are a good example of this. People were outraged for whatever reason, voted locally for these ultra right wing candidates, and now we have Tea Party candidates running for president.

You should also understand several of those justices want to continue to remove all money caps on all campaigns.  I like Mr. Sanders Quite a lot more, but given the choice we all know is inevitable, I'll be voting Hillary... I don't give a flying fuck about what person at a given time controls the WH...

And you seriously expect Hillary Clinton to appoint justices who are anti-government spying, willing to stand up to business, and willing to rule against the police and government when they violate civil rights?  Her picks might be better on LGBT rights and abortion, but marriage is on its way already, as are any remaining LGBT rights battles, and federal appointments are significantly less important for abortion battles than state legislatures lately.  

She isn't getting my vote because she's infinitesimally better than a Republican, or because she's a woman/Democrat.  And she isn't fucking inevitable. That's what she thought in 2008, and she lost to someone with better ideas.

Yes, the difference is that anyone who calls Clinton the ""worst President ever"" only does so because they're butthurt that Dubya *may actually be* the worst president ever by any measure. Clinton is not.

If Lincoln's time had the social media the we have now, he would've been ten times worse than Obama.

Keep in mind the worst times of both G.W. Bush and Obama came in the dates of social media; Bush really began to become unpopular about halfway through his second term (yes yes I know Democrats hated him before that, but they weren't NEARLY as vocal about it because they didn't have the means to do so), and Obama has had social media alive his entire term.

&gt;I've never seen anyone mention that they're voting because they're white, male and Christian. And if they did I would absolutely call them out on it. I'm an equal opportunity dick.

This is what you don't get....when it's the majority and you belong in the majority, you don't actually say ""I'm going to vote for so and so because they are so and so""...they just do it. But as I pointed out, if 20% of congress is women, then you would expect a 1 in 5 chance of women winning a primary and yet a woman has never won a primary. Almost as if men aren't voting for women. 

[Linda McMahon](http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/connecticut/senate/#.VUA__5Ob5UU) lost the woman vote 60-39!!! So women don't just vote for women. 

[Cynthia Dill](http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/maine/senate/#exitPoll) only got 16% of the womens vote while the 2 male candidates got the other 84%. 


http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/senate/#.VUA_65Ob5UU

Out of the 12 senate races in 2012 that  that featured only one women (so excluding woman vs woman), men only voted in the majority for women only 4 times and those were in lopsided races where the woman won by 21%, 34%, 20% and 16%!!! 

Men voted Republican almost 60% to 40% for Dems. So if I look at just the Republican women, I should expect about 60%/40% for Republican women running. There were 3 Republican women that ran against men. I couldn't find exit polling of Deb Fischer in Nebraska but for the other two Linda McMahon and Heather Wilson, both finished 50/50 among the male vote.

Obese_Child,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I do think that's likely the case for some... but that's not what the person I responded to was talking about.

Also, I think those high %s you listed has more to do with white males  currently just being the most common candidate for office by far. There's been a more recent effort to get women and minorities more involved in politics but it's going to take some time. I think it's more likely the rate at which women and minorities getting involved in politics/are candidates has just been a lot lower, and less likely that white christian guys are voting them out of competition or women and minorities not voting for their demographic as much. 

But like I said, things are slowly changing. This younger generation will likely see a lot more women and minorities involved in politics in their future, and when that happens you'll probably see said demographics voting for their own demographic (Obama and likely Hillary being examples) just as much. It's human nature, not just white people/men being particularly racist/sexist.

Hilary Clinton would be 68 by inauguration. It's not like she's much younger. That's really not what most people are paying attention to. I think, and I really hope, that these aren't the things people will use to detract from Sanders' campaigning.

McCain's age wasn't an issue until he chose Palin as his running mate.  Nobody knows what she would have done as president.  Obama/Biden is a pretty good pairing, since Biden has been around long enough that pretty much everyone can guess his opinion on any given subject without bothering to ask him.

REJECTED_FROM_MENSA,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Forgive me ignorance, but isn't Jewism a religion and not a race?"
Grosdoriane,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It's not ignorance at all, because you're right. I can't really speak from experience, but I believe many Jews consider themselves to ethno-culturally related. Many Jews are genetically related, but that common ancestry is not exactly required to be a part of the religion. From a legal standpoint in America, Jews can be classified as a race, especially in cases of discrimination. I believe that was a result of Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb. Technically, race is more dependent on shared physical traits, so Judaism is not a race. However, as a religion, there is more of a shared cultural background versus, say, Christians in America. 

When people refer to Judaism as a race, I think that they're generally using it as short hand for ""cultural group."" At least to me, this makes sense as to why some Jews will say that they aren't religious, but still self-identify as being Jewish. And on the flip side, I don't believe that every person who is a practicing Jew has to consider that as a part of their identity, outside of its religious implications. However, I don't know enough about Judaism to know how the religion deals with that aspect.

If someone who actually has more knowledge, or first hand experience, wants to correct me on all of this, please do. "

He is a politician. The most any politician deserves is something slightly above scorn. He is not honest, he wants power. Over you, over me, over the country as a whole. This is true of all politicians, even the ones I like a bit. This is especially true of a socialist politician. His honest goal is to take from me and give to others. It is a sick goal; the goal of a sociopath. "
barney75f7u12,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Maybe my judgement of him and of dem socialist ideals are rooted in naïveté, and that's totally possible, but there's plenty of evidence that supports the idea addressing income inequality to some measure, under the right circumstances. Public education is a prime example of free market exploitation. But if you liken taxes to thievery, then we have a fundamental difference of political philosophy (which is fine by me, seeing as people of my ilk get a lot of heat for that fundamental difference anyway; nothing I'm not used to, nor take offense to). 


I think you're right to be skeptical of any politician; we all should be. But speaking for myself only, I'm fond of Sanders record. He lacks verbal tact sometimes, but he represents a lot of the same things I have stakes in. "
Lemmiwinks99,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Wait, how is public education an example of free market exploitation? I take no issue with the rest of your post. I don't engage directly in the political process anyway. I view most politicians as no better or worse than Sanders."
barney75f7u12,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I should've specified and just put ""vouchers"" and ""accountability measures"" apply to public schools now, which are distinctively capitalistic, 'competitive' practices. But a more simplified version is something like this (formatting will be shit, as I'm on mobile):


1. For starters, there's a significant relationship between how much a school spends on a student (base student cost) and student achievement. Keeping that in mind, public schools are largely funded by local property taxes, therefore putting a significant portion of the school's collective achievement at the mercy of the local economy, social capital, wealth of the local parents, etc. Furthermore, public schools in impoverished areas don't receive the resources they need and suffer from poor performance due to, well, mainly underpaid and/or inexperienced teachers and the aforementioned collective lack of resources. Teacher turnover is a big problem in urban schools for some of these very reasons. 



2. Applying accountability measures only further exacerbate the problems because student achievement is low. It's basically shutting them down because the locals are in poverty. See, in certain areas, say, the Mississippi Delta (where I'm from), there might be one shitty public school in a district, but there will also be a private school (known here as a segregationist academy; no, for real) or a charter school (which is partially, but usually mostly funded by vouchers aka public tax money that belongs in a public school). Both charter schools and private schools are unfair competition for public schools, especially since they've been shown to be highly discriminatory in student selection.







3. Charter schools (think *Waiting For Superman*) not only bleed public school funds dry, but are largely unregulated vis-a-vis teacher standards and student achievement. There's also a massive corporate interest in making these suckers successful. Research ALEC (I personally love *The United States of ALEC* documentary from Bill Moyers) and learn how they influence politics in the U.S. It's nothing short of a goddamn conspiracy. These fuckers (read: ""politicians"") use the word ""choice"" as a selling point, but all it really is, is the exploitation of the poor in search of profit.






4. So in this instance, applying the typical survival-of-the-fittest, capitalist mentality to public schools is a sure-fire way to reproduce present inequalities and racial hierarchies. It's not only cyclical, but exploitive (at least in my mind). "
Lemmiwinks99,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"1. Why would anyone want to spend money to educate their neighbors kids when they could spend it to educate their kids instead?

2. So, teachers of poor students cannot be objectively measured for their success?

3. If charter schools only take the money allotted to the students who attend them, how can they bleed the system dry?
&gt;argely unregulated vis-a-vis teacher standards and student achievement. There's also a massive corporate interest in making these suckers successful
How do you square these statements? We need the govt to reegulate these schools because the capitalists who run them are too interested in them being successful, what?

4. Get rid of public school. In India people have set up over-achieving private schools in the poorest of areas. Why are America's poor less motivated to be educated unlike much of the rest of the world?

alanpugh,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"He calls himself a ""democratic socialist,"" which is a progressive supporter of capitalism.  He does not endorse expropriating resources to the workers.  This is really easy stuff."
Lemmiwinks99,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"He has recently explicitly advocated taking from the wealthy and giving to the workers (estate tax and min wage). Dem socialism is not in support of capitalism. It is merely a socialist economic doctrine paired with a democratic political doctrine. It is socialists trying to claim legitimacy through democracy. He is a socialist, as I said. Just because he is a specific type of socialist does not make his ideas and therefore his policies less idiotic."
alanpugh,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Sorry, /u/Lemmiwinks99, but you simply don't know what socialism is.

Socialism is, at its most basic concept, worker ownership (and therefore democratization) of the means of production.  This generally means the abolition of private property, of wage labor for capital, of corporate-owned factories and natural resources, etc.

Citing minimum wage, a designated wage which capital must pay in exchange for labor, as a socialist policy, fails to understand even the most basic understanding of the word.  If workers are trading their labor to capitalists in exchange for wages, it is capitalism, full stop."
Lemmiwinks99,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I did not list min wage as a form of socialism. However, min wage is certainly not a policy which favors capitalism and it absolutely takes resources and puts them in the hands of the workers at the expense of the owners. One of the many problems with socialism is the poor job it does of distinguishing between what is and is no a resource. 
I assume Sanders knows what socialism is well enough that he chooses to identify as a socialist."

We've been working for a over a year (since December, 2013 to be precise) to build up a large, informative, and supportive knowledge-base for all things pertaining to Senator Sanders. We want him in the White House, and if you're reading this and you have ANY interest in learning more about him, his voting history, and the beliefs he stands for, please pay us a visit! I'm attaching several resources to this comment as well - just keep reading.

If you want to chip in and help the cause, go ahead and subscribe to the subreddit. Participate as often as possible. Visit multiple times a day, read the comments, and **learn all that you can.** Spread the word far and wide! Bernie DOES have a chance. It's defeatist and flat-out wrong to say anything otherwise - you're just creating a self-fulfilling prophecy if you speak that way. He's honest, authentic, and one of the only people out there standing up for the common men and women of America. But even though it's going to take a lot of work to triumph over Hillary and her endless pockets of Wall Street money, we can still do it.

Look at it this way. There is ZERO risk in voting for him in the Primary, because if he earns the Democratic nomination, GREAT! He'll have a great chance at beating the ""best"" Republican candidate. And if he loses to Hillary, that's too bad, but you can still always just vote for her if you *really* don't want a Republican in the White House. But he won't be a spoiler. He won't cause a Nader Effect. And if you disregard all the stigma and misinformation, and just let his policies and 35 year history do the talking, the choice is obvious. He needs to be the next President of the United States of America. And he can be. 

* [Link to his official campaign website](https://www.berniesanders.com)  
* [Link to his OnTheIssues.org page](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/bernie_sanders.htm#). Don't let people spread misinformation! Learn as much as you can about Senator Sanders and spread the knowledge far and wide. His opponents will make up whatever kind of baseless, slanderous nonsense possible to derail him and his message. The best way to defend against that is to PROVE them wrong, with citations and facts.  
* [Link to his official 12-step platform](https://berniesanders.com/issues/)

And before anyone asks - No. I do not work for Senator Sanders or his campaign. I am just a regular person like you that has decided it's time to try and fight for the things I believe in. You can too. Join us at /r/SandersForPresident.

Blunderaem,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Depends on the scenario.  

You are right in cases like late 2008 when McCain was locked in far earlier than Hillary or Obama, or in 2012 when Obama was effectively locked in immediately with the GOP open to go.  There is the potential for sabotage there.

There is the flipside, though.  Let's go to a hypothetical race.  On the Dem side there were two candidates I'd be okay with in a vacuum.  On the GOP side there were two on the same tier.  Who I liked might be too liberal for the GOP primary voters and too conservative for the Dem primary voters.  

I'd like the ability to vote among these four to five for the one I'd like best to go to the general and hope one of the others win for the other party.  Instead I am either forced to sit back and pray I don't get a ""lesser devil"" situation or to join a party for lip service so they can have inflated membership numbers.

Honestly, I'd prefer some sort of run-off system.  Not just for third party candidates to have a better chance to win, but to allow candidates who aren't party cookie cutters to have a chance as well."

Many states disagree with you and disallow closed primaries.

It's not irrelevant, because by determining the viable candidate pool, you're disenfranchising more people than anyone determining the candidate pool.

I'm all for abolishing political parties entirely, but since that's not going to happen I'm going to take as much democracy as I can get, and closed primaries gets in the way of that.

I don't think that 56% of people should get to determine the candidate pool for 100% of the country. But that is exactly what happens with closed primaries.

It's a reasonable position in a system where everybody is a member of a viable political party. In a system where independents outnumber the members of both political parties individually, it is not a reasonable system as it excludes the largest voting bloc from the ""Primary"" elections. From this position it is obviously undemocratic.

I don't refuse to acknowledge them. Hell, I voted Green in 2012. But the political reality is the American political machine will put either a Democrat or a Republican in the White House in 2016.

ComebackShane,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Respectfully disagree. Open primaries in lopsided districts/states result in the other party 'raiding' the primary of the opposition, trying to get the more weaker candidate to make it to the general election.

Imagine a High School where each club had a candidate face off in school-wide elections for class president. In a closed primary, only members of the Chess club could choose their candidate, only Drama club members could choose theirs, Dance chooses dance, etc etc. Every student can only vote once.

Now imagine an open primary, where you can vote for *any* club candidate, even if you're not in that club. Suppose the Band club has a single candidate they all agree on, but know the dashing leading man over in the Drama club might be a challenger in the school-wide election. So they all agree to crash the Drama elections and vote for the creepy techie in the trenchcoat. Suddenly, the Drama club is cheated of their representation in the general election, and the Band rep wins due to his sweet, sweet saxaphone skills.

Open primaries are good in theory, but they're a solution to the wrong problem.

ckwing,143,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Ron Pauler here. You will need to:

1. Raise tens of millions of dollars from grassroots

2. Don't expect that Bernie will know what to do with millions of dollars in campaign funds just because he's a ""good guy."" Ron Paul proved totally incompetent in effectively utilizing his millions in 2008 ([see this hilariously cringe-worthy ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30yxHqSUva8) and strategically unsound (though slightly more competent)) in 2012. In fact, what you really need is to divert some of those millions to a PAC run by someone competent and unafraid in the grassroots, who will say the hard-hitting things the campaign is afraid to say. Arguably the [most effective Ron Paul 2012 ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rv0Z5SNrF4) (done in response to the newsletter scandal) came not from the campaign but from one of the superPACs.

3. Know your enemy. If you want to have a shot in hell, study Paul's two campaigns, and know that your biggest enemy in defeating Hillary will not be Hillary's campaign or the super PACs, but the media. The media are the ones who will kneecap your candidate if he gains any actual traction. On the Democratic side, you've already seen this with Ralph Nader's campaigns. The Rand Paul grassroots (which I include myself in) is still searching for a decent strategy to prevent the inevitable media knee-capping of Rand.

4. In addition to moderate knee-capping all season long, expect the media to especially screw you over at crucial junctures. Again, see Ron Paul 2012 for examples: one week before the Iowa primary, with Paul #1 in all the Iowa polls, they manufactured the ""Santorum surge"" out of thin air while suddenly, randomly choosing to obsess over the newsletter ""scandal"" (without getting into another debate with newsletter trolls, regardless of your opinion on that ""scandal,"" the timing of the media's decision to focus on it was incredibly blatant, given that this was an old scandal that could have been brought up at any fucking time over several decades or any time during the 2012 or 2008 campaign season).

5. ~~Profit!~~ Win!

Bonus step: Find an ideologically pure/un-corrupt millionaire/billionaire to help out. In 2012 the largest contributor to Ron Paul's campaign (via superPACs) was Peter Thiel, who donated a few million. Also in 2008 Peter Schiff, a well-known investment manager, acted on his conscience and [sent a personal letter](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:GAy9IIY82F0J:www.dailypaul.com/6092/investment-advisor-peter-schiff-appeals-to-60000-in-e-mail-blast+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) to all his clients urging them to support Paul.

As reddit users, many of us are accustomed to finding our information using a variety of internet based sources, some telling you only what you want to hear, some presenting pure B.S., some providing as close to an unbiased view that you'll get, and so on. But one thing we know we can't depend on for well, pretty much anything, is the mainstream media. With them seated firmly in the back pockets of other interests, they'll do anything to skew info in their favored direction. The problem is that too many people out there still rely on it and do not realize that what they are watching is strictly pushed agenda and entertainment geared towards ratings. It has become a joke that far too many good people who have a few short minutes to be engaged in ""news"" use to their own detriment.

That's how word of mouth goes...

And there's the [Dunning–Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), which ensures that all those least-informed people at the water cooler will come across just as persuasively and confidently -- if not moreso -- than you will."

This might not be the correct answer but I think things were much less bureaucratic back then and for a procedure like delivering a stillborn child, which might have only involved an ob-gyn and maybe a nurse, the doctor/nurse may have either had the prerogative to waive fees or at least the ability to initiate whatever administrative process allows fees to be waived.

No offense, but I don't think you know much about political ideology. First, Rand Paul is barely even a right-libertarian, he's pretty much a Republican who's OK with weed. Second, Sanders is a social democrat, although he labels himself a socialist. There are hundreds of European politicians who have more radical views them him.

Third, if you were a left-libertarian than you wouldn't really be excited by a right-libertarian, because they believe in maximizing the power of Capital and other private hierarchies (as opposed to weakening both Capital and the State). So I'm not sure if you are self-identifying correctly."

I think the American electoral system is bullshit and unreformable but you might as well check the box for Sanders if only to get some new ideas spreading in the public discourse.

What passes for the left in the developed world these days is really best described as neutered moderates.

Rand Paul might have some good views but he has an overwhelming amount of bad ones, too.

Well considering the distance between a generic republican and a generic democrat is miniscule, the distance to either of those candidates becomes extreme.

Oh yea, I have a severe distaste for Rand Paul's PR and his policies, especially as they would effect the current state of affairs. I finally figured out why everyone is getting so worked up about this. I meant which primary to vote in (open primary state); probably should have made that more clear. Since neither party is anywhere near my views, it will be a hard choice to back the republican party becoming more libertarian or the democratic party moving more to the left. Sanders has my vote in a general against Rand Paul (or any other republican)."

Mason-B,6,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Thanks for telling me what to think, but my definition of libertarian is different than yours (and is more in-line with what Europeans call libertarians) and isn't entirely predicated on the whole force nonsense (which is certainly a useful tool, but not the basis of my philosophy).

The socialism I am interested (from a left-libertarian viewpoint) that Bernie Sanders has described as policy positions are Trade Unions, Co-ops, and environmental protection. The only members of the republican parties who can offer competing things are the right libertarians (like Ron Paul and Rand Paul)."
orthecreedence,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"This is an interesting take, and I'm intrigued by what you mean as a European libertarian.

I have two definitions of libertarian.

1. One who truly believes that market forces are able to self-regulate to the extent that government is no longer needed (a balanced state of anarcho-capitalism). There are no ""corporations"" as much as there are individuals trading amongst each other, in a state of trust (as in ""I trust that nobody else will steal from me because everyone else has what they need"" or ""I trust that I can defend myself from someone who does try to steal from me"" etc). This is what I know from studying libertarian literature from my late-teens anarcho-communist days.
2. American libertarians. They support deregulation because they equate it to paying less (or no?) taxes. They support state's (and individual) rights on almost every issue. In general, they tend to ignore the effect that corporate america will have on the country sans regulation and justify this by touting the ""power of the boycott"" if it comes up. They support privatization of *everything* because they think it will always, 100%, be more efficient than publicly run services (ignoring companies like Comcast).

Obviously I'm a bit biased against people who self-proclaim libertarianism in the US. I've gotten into several discussions with many of them on different issues and inevitably end up thinking they are delusional.

As someone who calls themselves a libertarian, what's your ideal political/economic landscape? You seem to have a different handle on it than others I've met."
Mason-B,3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"By European libertarian I basically mean moderate libertarianism. Essentially [classic liberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism) with a small-government/personal freedom bent. As for left-libertarian, it's generally called [libertarian socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism), and the occupy movement has a lot of left-libertarian flavor to it.

Ideally? I'm looking towards the future, for example where automation is going to [replace millions of jobs in this country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU). The eventual goal is an hedonistic anarchist utopia (for example: [The Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture)), so basically, for now, we have to bridge the gap between now and post-scarcity.

Free-market capitalism is fine for most of that, economically speaking, but self-organizing co-ops, trade unions, and things like collaborative infrastructure (e.g. [mesh nets](https://projectmeshnet.org/) and solar neighborhoods) could really be useful if we merely educate people on them (and remove some old laws restricting them). But also we'll probably need a basic income, which I would prefer to come from property taxes, but it's sort of a necessity to deal with the coming automation.

I'd also like to see the eventual rise of direct democracy, removal of most restrictions on personal freedoms, and more local organizational structures. I see this being possible with improving technology. Generally it's about getting people to work together to build the future they want. 

I guess my thing is I'm a moderate and a realist (meaning I'm fine with government for now, and just want to change it so it at least serves the people again), and I think left-libertarian policies are the best way to close the gap between now and the future."
orthecreedence,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Thanks for the detailed, informative response.

It's funny, we share a lot of the same views. I tend to *ideally* favor abolishment of ownership (I still have an anarcho-communist streak), but realistically see that not happening for tens of thousands of years (humanity has a long way to go before evolving past ""this is mine"").

I like your description of free trade and smaller government. My only fear with smaller government when mixed with our current American Capitalist system is that the government would not have the power to regulate the absolute domination over market and government corporations seem to desire. I think we would need a cultural shift before this is possible. I honestly think this will happen naturally. Our capitalist system has grown so enormous based on the principals of dominating other countries, but there are very few backs left to climb on. I smell an economic collapse coming up, especially because so many economists in the US seem to think our growth is infinite.

Basic income is another thing I'd love to see before I die (if nothing else, to see if it works). The idea that we waste so much time and money on determining who gets what cut of the pie from taxes seems silly when we could just pool the money and redistribute it to all citizens. I suppose our current system's version of this is minimum wage, which a) seems to get continuously left behind as far as inflation goes, not that basic income wouldn't and b) only applies if you are employed with a full-time job (which the current market cannot always provide).

Going to check out those links you sent, thanks."

Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt; My only fear with smaller government when mixed with our current American Capitalist system is that the government would not have the power to regulate the absolute domination over market and government corporations seem to desire.

Oh I totally agree, it's the whole thing occupy was worried about. As a moderate, I agree with how this has to be done carefully.

&gt; I suppose our current system's version of this is minimum wage

I view basic income as a way to bring the labor market closer to a free market. To backup a second, the labor market cannot be a free market in a capitalist society: to live you must have money, to have money you must have job; it's coercive (as far as what is and isn't a free market are concerned), even if it's our nature which is coercive. Hence, the basic income removes the coercive aspect of the labor market with only a minor manipulation as the last vestige of interference (assuming we remove the minimum wage, and a number of other things no longer needed). It makes the labor market more free."
orthecreedence,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt; libertarian policies don't

Keep in mind, libertarianism is a socio-political state (taken to its logical conclusion is anarcho-capitalism), socialism is *just* an economic state. People often confuse state's rights and federal marijuana legislation with libertarianism. In fact, very few libertarians are actually libertarians, they just think they are because they don't want to pay taxes.

Also, the while the socialist ""force"" you speak of is administered by a governmental body, the libertarian force comes from the free market, which can be much more cruel. The freedoms it affords are often not worth the pain it brings. For instance, food stamps/welfare would be nonexistent in a libertarian state, and so anyone who had no value (or perceived value) OR had value but was not in demand would be left for dead. This is when most people say ""SO?!"" because it has never happened to them...but markets ebb and flow, and a prince one day can be a pauper the next."
yuekit,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Defining force as only government coercion seems too limited to me. An ultra-capitalist society where a few live in luxury and the majority in grinding poverty may be free on paper, but how many people get to experience that freedom? This is where the new American right-wing libertarianism falls short. I think it's useful to look at societies where people have the most amount of actually existing freedom, defined by social freedom, civil liberties and quality of life. "

DoorMarkedPirate,5,U.S. Sen.

The Labour Party in the UK/Australia, the NDP in Canada, the Socialist Party in France, and other left-wing parties in Western Europe  (including Scandinavian countries) are social democratic or democratic socialist parties, which are members of [Socialist International](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International).  Socialist International was  created by democratic socialists and social democrats as opposed to the Comintern created by Marxist-Leninists; they are still correctly described as ""socialist"".  While the degree to which each individual party or member of the party wants to transition to socialism from capitalism can be argued, members of these schools of thought (and ruling governments) still self-identify as ""socialists"". 

Similarly, the communist parties in the USSR, the Soviet bloc, Cuba, and modern-day China diverged in other ways from the original revolutionary ideal of Marx, but also defined themselves under the blanket of ""socialism.""

This is also the definition that Republicans and conservative political pundits *want* you to associate with socialism, as it means any socialist principles can be easily discounted by drawing parallels to a Red Menace rather than Sweden, Germany, the UK, or France.  

State socialism is only one type of socialism and even discounted by many orthodox Marxists as well as socialist thinkers as ""state capitalism"", since the state controlled the national economy and still engaged in capital accumulation.  

Outside of the US, the term ""socialism"" encompasses a far wider range of beliefs in political discourse.  This is why France, Belgium, and Portugal have major political parties called ""the Socialist Party"".  This is also why many of these social democratic and democratic socialist parties aren't concerned with being part of an organization called the Socialist International.

In Mexico, both the PRI and the PRD are members of Socialist International, with 41% and 21% of the Chamber of Deputies, respectively, with the PRI also being the party of Mexican President Peña Nieto.

Tortankum,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,Idk man. In my home state a third part candidate ran for governor and got like 20% of the vote and one of his main points was that he spent less than 40 dollars on his campaign. Everyone I knew didn't vote for him because they didn't want to pull votes away from their party of choice.
lesterbovine,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I love Bernie. In my perfect world, people like him would dominate the democratic party and the right would be the mainstream dems of today.

But what I am worried about is that in the primaries he will push Hillary too far to the left. Not that she doesn't believe in liberal policies (I truly believe she's a lib dem, not a mod dem), but she doesn't have to announce it to the whole US via the Fox news propaganda machine.

In the general election, Hillary (or whoever else is the democratic candidate) will have to carry their primary policies/stances to a much more moderate general electorate, especially in the swing states, which could be the crucial difference maker.

I'm excited for Bernie but wary about Dems chances for the top prize. I would rather have a powerless democratic president in name only (ie Obama) vs an unhinged republican any day, if only because the house and senate will most likely be controlled by republicans for the near future."
meta4one,-3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Thats all bullshit though. Look at Obama, hes just as bad as any republican than could have been elected in his place, if not worse."
Trying2BaWiseGuy,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Obama appointed Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade and kept gay marriage illegal? He maintained an uninsured rate of nearly 20% for healthcare (having the emergency room be health insurance), kept unemployment above 10%, cut pell grants, put troops on the ground in two new countries, gave tax cuts to the rich, privatized social security so that benefits would depend on stock market performance, and increased Medicare costs for seniors?

Because that's exactly what Republicans talked about doing in 2008 and 2012, or that's what they actually did when they were President.

I don't seem to recall Obama doing any of that. Strange. It's almost as though you've bought into the corporate media narrative that Obama has been ineffective, an effort to disenchant people and stop them from voting..."
pacfcqlkcj4,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"That's straight hyperbole and you know it. Obama got some health care reform through. It's not perfect by any means, but it happened. He pushed hard for more stimulus for the recovery. He got some. Again, not enough, but in the right direction. He's done things on the economic front pretty well, if consistently too small, most likely due to Congressional roadblocks.

He's been terrible on privacy, drones, etc. That makes him equal to the best of the Republicans on those fronts. He still comes out way ahead of them overall.

He hasn't been perfect. He hasn't been as good as we hoped. He has not been particularly bad, and he's been way better than the opposition. He's also been better than I imagine Clinton would have been in the same position."

So it's more important to not vote for someone who is ""fake like Hillary"" in the primaries, ensuring that they lose in the general to the GOP candidate, than it is to vote for a winnable contender and have the Democrats win the White House. Gotcha.

Gotcha.

It's early and other candidates have time to step forward.  Hillary could always drop out too for a variety of reasons.  I seriously hope the Democrats get a better candidate than Hillary, however she has the big money behind her and all of the people who have bought shares of Clinton Inc. are doing what they can to get all of their political favors granted when the Clintons retake their throne.  I fear this has scared other potential contenders away.  No family, neither the Clintons, the Kochs nor the Bushes, should have this much power and control over the direction of the United States.  She may be the lesser of two evils by the time the primaries come around though.

The good thing about a Sanders / Warren ticket, or simply just a Sanders ticket, is that they contribute to the political discourse of our time.  Even if Sanders doesn't win the primary, his participation could get the country talking about important issues it otherwise would not be discussing.  That is its own success."

slipaway,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Are you trying to compare Sanders to Hilary or Barack? Seriously?

Their positions were practically mirror images of one another, perfectly manufactured to garner the most votes possible in swing states. Those two were were in a blood-feud to see who could appeal to the ""progressive"" youth during primaries, and then shift to the center for the election. 

Bernie is so far left he may as well be Lenin. He will not make it far into the primaries because 1: the progressive young people who are his base have the absolute WORST turnout during elections and 2. The Democratic party machine will eat him alive before they ever see him come close to being a contender for a national election.

Having said that I welcome him in declaring his candidacy because he will bring important issues into the election cycle that Hillary will never dare engage on here own. 

If given the opportunity, I would gladly throw away my vote to a candidate that has no chance of winning if only to say at least one time in my life I voted for a presidential candidate that actually gave a damn about me or anything other than ingratiating himself into the Washington political machine and selling his soul for reelection."

Are you implying it *wasn't* in 2012?  Obama and the DNC were all over social media and blasting emails constantly.  Even his supporters were getting tired of the constant barrage.  Networks did their best to make it a horse race, it was covered in all forms of media incessantly.  All of that and Obama still only got 1/4 of his funding from small donors and just 4 years later the price to run is expected to double.

I have trouble believing that an elderly white man can excite the DNC enough to even match the previous election's level of small donor support much less increasing it dramatically.  Since I made the Ron Paul comparison want to know what he raised from small donors in 2012?  $18M."

Now to expand upon that point, Obama in 2012 raised $230M from small donors out of $1.1B total.  Obama was the incumbent and had the full support of the Democratic Party behind him and faced no challengers.  Does anyone really think that Bernie can raise that much money?"

This is a candidate that not only says the right things and holds the right values, but has the *extensive* track record to back those up. The progressives are an untapped group in America, we haven't had a progressive candidate to get fired up over in a long time, but now we do."
SomeNorCalGuy,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I kind of remember the progressives getting pretty fired up for this one Barack something something guy about 8 years ago -- I wonder whatever happened to him...

In all seriousness though, please advocate and work tirelessly for (and don't forget to vote for) the candidate that you personally feel will be the best leader. That's one of the best thing you can do to help ensure a fully functional democracy.

HOWEVER 

If you want to have someone in the white house who shares most of your views instead of almost almost none of them, then what you want (maybe not now, but eventually) is not someone who will get the progressives completely and passionately on board, but someone who will speak to middle America. Much like the Republicans and the Tea Party, traditional Democrats don't want to get the progressive faction completely on their side but neither do they want to draw their ire so much they run their own candidate (something they would have been mildly concerned about if Sanders had run as an independent. But now that he's a Democrat, all he has to do is lose by the numbers.)

Pulling to far to the left will lose you the middle (just as pulling too far to the right does). If the Republicans run a center right candidate like Jeb Bush and the Democrats run a progressive like Sanders, that could lose you Virginia and Nevada and Florida. And if Walker runs as VP, that could be just enough to pick off Wisconsin and Michigan - and then it's game over for the Democrats and you've got a GOP House and Senate and President for at least a couple of years. And that scares the crap out of me.

Out of the 2 people on the left who are running for President, there's only one so far that fits the center left bill, and she's not THAT popular, so I don't blame anyone for seeking an alternative. I myself am holding out for Jim Webb to announce his candidacy, and I'd take a close look at Brian Schweitzer as well. But at the end of the day I'm going to choose someone who shares 75% of my views and can win over someone who shares 90% of my views and might lose."

As a permanent resident and soon-to-be citizen of the United States of America, I feel strongly about politics and the direction of our country. I like Bernie's stance on many issues, and am planning on donating to his cause and voting for him. Politics is extremely dirty and corporations have WAY too much sway on legislation, and it needs to end. 

Bernie has my vote.

On global warming: 

* Sanders is a vocal advocate about the ramifications of global warming. In a speech on the Senate floor on     July 26, 2012, Sanders addressed claims made by fellow Senator Jim Inhofe: ""The bottom line is when    Senator Inhofe says global warming is a hoax, he is just dead wrong, according to the vast majority of    climate scientists.""

* * It's sad that it's so valiant for someone to point out science and the facts simply because the opposition is filling their pockets up to defend what is wrong, but, alas, here we are, and Bernie is standing up for the truth, as dramatic as the sounds. That's a lot of commas.

On Public Disclosures and Transparency:

* Sanders supports the DISCLOSE Act, which would make campaign finances more transparent and ban U.S. corporations controlled by foreign interests from making political expenditures.

* * In other words, he's against dirty politics.

On BEING A GOOD HUMAN BEING AND ACCEPTING EVERYONE:

* Sanders is a social liberal, supporting LGBT rights, same-sex marriage, and pro-choice legislation.

* * I know this is a contested issue, but in my personal opinion, this shouldn't even be a question in this day and age. Another point for him."

His policies would appeal to the more moderate and center voters who would be much more likely to vote for him based on these rather than against him based on a stupid scare tactics.

People in these swing states who actually see his policies would be willing to vote for him regardless of what term is attached to him. If you give a moderate voter the run down of his policies and they agree with them they are not suddenly going to be turned off because of a word associated with him. The only people stupid enough to be scared of voting for someone based on a word and not their policies are already voting Republican.

There is a large chunk of people who are stupid enough to be turned off by the word despite possibly agreeing with the ideology itself but these people where never going to vote for a democratic nominee regardless."

HairyAsHull,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"That is very narrow sided metric. What about the military? What about other domestic policies? Liberty vs. Security? Morality? 

You are missing a lot of fucking points. "
demon4372,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Rofl, no. Your idea of ""left"" is completely at odds with reality. The US's Social Security programs aren't actually *that* large in comparison to most western countries (which is why i say you are much further right than the rest of the world).

In some ways, Europe is actually economically to the right of america, due to the massive austerity programs that EU countries have adopted while america didn't. Making massive cuts to public finances to work to reduce deficits, although for many EU countries this was a necessity due to the debt problems that would have occurred if they didn't.  

But to suggest that america, or even Europe, is left due to social security programs completely ignores any actual current or historical concept of left wing. The only real ""left wing"" parties in most western countries are center-left, and even then many on the left would say they aren't actually left since they accept modern ""neoliberal capitalism"". And the countries, and their electorates themselves are by no means left wing, since they continue to elect and support right wing parties.  

Take Britain, we haven't been a left wing country since 1979, none of our mainstream parties are advocating creating a socialist country in Britain anymore, the only proper socialist left wing parties are polling at like 4/5%. 

The only actual left wing mainstream parties are in places like Greece, which has come as a reaction to the austerity that has been pushed on Greece by the EU.

Your absurd definition of ""left"" just really shows that you are a component part of the absurd far-right in america, that the rest of the world laughs at. 

&gt;will soon be paying even more for Obamacare. Any nation that institutes strong welfare and entitlements is to the left

I would also make a note about Welfare and Healthcare. Part of the reason we in Europe have these programs, such as the National Heath Service in the UK, is not because of current politics, it is because these programs were installed back when there were actual and genuine left wing parties, and when the neoliberal parties took hold, due to the public want for those programs, and the fact *they worked* they were never abolished. 

In the UK there are no parties, not even the really right wing ones like UKIP (the leader of which has been invited by Fox News a number of times, and always spouts his populist views and is complemented by Fox) would never even dare suggest that they would abolish the NHS, just because it is like a national religion in the UK. Despite almost all the parties standing on welfare-reduction platforms (including the center-left ones). "
taco_bones,-1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Awesome, when will we get these entitlements and welfare? Forcing people to purchase products from corporations doesn't sound like much of an entitlement to me."
demon4372,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt;Forcing people to purchase products from corporations doesn't sound like much of an entitlement to me.

It's literally a right wing healthcare program. If it wasn't for the political climate and religious idealization of the NHS, i am sure that right wing parties in the UK would be pushing for a Obamacare style system. "
demon4372,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt;To me, left is left, and right is right.

demon4372,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Has it? There are currently center-right governments in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India ext. The first and third largest political grouping in the European Parliament are a center-right, the president of the EU commission and council are centre right, and there has been a distinct rise of right wing parties/politics recently. Even in countries where there are ""center left"" governments, they are almost all socially democratic governments that are closer to the capitalist parties than genuine socialism.  

In the last 30 years the world has defiantly moved economically to the right, especially in places like the UK and Europe. Like in the UK we moved away from the Socialist post-war movement towards a more capitalist neo-liberal position.

*America* has moved to the right aswell, the point is, american has moved much much further that the rest of the world, which i assume is where your weird proclamation that the world has moved to the left has come from."

I'm sorry but the world hasn't changed that much.

Never in our history has that happened and the stakes in 2016 are much higher than normal. If Sanders doesn't show he can win his policy positions don't matter.

The ""independent voter"" thing is a myth. When tracked, most independents actually have a party. They just are upset with it, so they claim independent. But at the end of the day, they still vote with their party. It's more about a candidate being convincing enough to encourage them to get out and vote.

&gt; All that takes to overcome is a little education and explaining why the average person would be better off NOT in the quasi-capitalistic oligarchy that we have now.

There's your problem. You're trying to live in an ideal world, not a practical one. Voters don't have the desire nor time to get educated on things like this. It's just not realistic. If people were able to be educated on things, we wouldn't have these messes to begin with. 

Especially with something like socialism. That's not going to go down easily, no matter how much facts and evidence you have. We have decades of cultural mores to press against, which just isn't going to happen.

Sorry, but you are naive. And being fed up with it, doesn't change reality.

I'm not under the same delusions that Sanders will introduce broad sweeping changes the way that I and most people were when Obama was voted in, but I have no doubt he would be better suited for the job than either Hillary or anything the GOP puts forward.

Sadly I feel like Hillary is a pretty tough representative to overcome simply based on the mania over her when she lost the nomination to Obama and the fact that she's just a more visible household name for the average voter who isn't going to work that hard to figure out what a given candidate is really about."

This is awful, because that means that we will have to suffer through terribly policy, to be rewarded with a Republican president... and only after *that* term can we start to talk about reforming the status quo.

No republican is winning a national election in 2 years. It's not happening. Their voting block is old and dying, and the millenial tidal wave that washed Obama in will be 8 years older with a pretty vocal and active new progressive young generation creeping up behind the Millenials. The electoral map is turning more and more blue. By 2020 Texas will be blue.

Attack Hillary on things the GOP won't ever touch her on: Money and it's influence, for one. Stay on message and let the Fox News be Bernie's biggest supporter.

We need a message and a candidate who truly speaks for the American people.

""Our country's political process is bought and if we don't fix it now it will be irreversible. There's a trillion dollars of unremoveable student loan debt that is an anchor around millions of recent graduates who have no opportunities to return that investment. Our infrastructure is crumbling while we spent trillions on War. Wages have been stagnant and deflated and the cost of living has increased. The top 1% cratered the economy and then saw 99% of all new financial gains since. The middle class is disappearing and the safety net keeping many Americans afloat is under attack from the billionaire class and their wallets and mouthpieces who are exteacting billions from the economy.""

The candidate is Bernie Sanders. "
safety_jam,71,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I think it's pretty clear to every progressive minded voter that Bernie Sanders is by and far the best candidate for president in a generation (or several). Frankly, he is probably the only hope America has of achieving an equal and prosperous future. The country is literally at the brink and the ponzi scheme of crony capitalism is this close to collapsing - it's highly unlikely that it will last another 8 years. 

The problem is convincing a very large conglomeration of honest, hardworking, but - let's not mince words - simple people who's live are primarily focused on their own lives and their families, who don't travel outside their home states, who don't follow world politics or understand competing economic theories, who are informed by the occasional glance at newspaper stand or what they see for a few hours at night on Fox or MSNBC. They are just getting by and working hard and they don't really care if gay marriage is legal or abortion is illegal or how much a bank bailout costs or just, exactly, where Yemen is on the map. 

These are the people that need to be motivated - they are worlds apart from /r/politics. Granted, they will understand and probably agree with the message, but it's matter of getting that message to them and getting it there without it being warped by a dozen different pundits who are paid quite a lot of money to make sure people  are provided with doubt and fear and uncertainty. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, Bernie Sanders might be best possible presidential candidate America can find, but he is going to face the most difficult and uphill battle potentially ever faced by a candidate. 

Hillary is by far an objectively worse candidate, but she is the definition of a shoe-in. Literally the only thing she has to do to win is not fuck up and let the GOP twist themselves into a meaningless, pasty white knot. The Democratic party's mission is to win an election, nothing more. They aren't interested in the best  candidate, they're interested in the candidate that will win. 

Don't get me wrong - it can be done. But Bernie Sanders and every single person who has any insight into the state of America will have to fit harder than likely any candidate has before to overcome every instinct of a short-sighted, for profit electoral system in order to win. 

Godspeed to you all. "

1. Hillary is a conservative.

Actually Hillary is / was one of the most liberal politicians we had in the Senate by voting record. Much more liberal than Obama.

2. Hillary is a criminal!

No evidence of wrongdoing has been found despite decades of searching, and lack of evidence is not evidence of guilt. 

3. Hillary is a money grubbing sleaze

Hillary was one of the founders of one of the worlds most reputable charities dedicated to helping people mostly in poor conditions. She has a lot of money but has historically championed people's values.

I actually support Sanders more than Hillary but I think it's sad to see people stoop so low as to make up the kind of crap Rove would in a think tank."

She never met a war she didn't like.

She has never advocated a truly progressive position unless she was running for office. Even now her hard pivot to the left is miles ahead of where she was in 2008. 

I just don't trust her. Her newfound progressive agenda is suspect since her actions and record indicate she will just be a continuation of Obama's policies."
,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"In my opinion a lot of these concerns are overblown.

- Can't take anyone serious when they have Goldman Sachs turning over 6 figure checks.

Part of the reason that is the case is she is front runner for the democratic nomination. If Bernie can get the nomination, he will get checks like that and he will need them to win. Holding this against Hillary is short sighted IMHO.

- She has never advocated a truly progressive position unless she was running for office. Even now her hard pivot to the left is miles ahead of where she was in 2008.

Actually she has been one of the most progressive politicians in office when elected. This is her record, not rhetoric.

&gt; ***Does openly supporting a political candidate (i.e., Obama) represent a tacit endorsement of all of that politician's positions (drone strikes, indefinite detention of terror suspects, etc.)?***
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course it does but what the fuck else are you going to do, support the fascist? In a choice between AIDS and the clap, you chose the clap, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to choose between a bowl of ice cream and AIDS instead? If you vote for Obama you are voting for drone strikes, but if you vote for Romney you are voting for war with Iran. You can't ever get what you want, vote or don't but do not delude yourself that somehow the Democrats are the good guys, they are just the less diabolical guys. 

This is not a new opinion by any means.  South Park did it with the Giant Douche vs. Turd Sandwich, Reddit is forever going on about how both parties are the same etc or only have slight differences and there's a lot of truth to it.

But I think we've finally got it. **Bernie Sanders is that bowl of ice cream.**  Seriously.  I don't think I've been able to say that about any presidential candidate in either of the two major parties ever, even in the primaries.  Actually, Kucinich was quite good.  As I recall my issue with him was that if he actually won he'd just get demolished by the Republicans and none of his great ideas (the kind that the majority of the Democratic Party do not support and the VAST majority of the Republican Party do not support) would be able to take flight.  But Bernie Sanders doesn't seem like the type to cater to people, get bowled over by the Republicans and/or members of his own party, and, in the end of the day I feel he could seriously make incredible strides for this country.

P.S.

I'm not sure why it has to be a choice between ice cream and AIDS...why can't it be a choice between a bowl of ice cream and a bowl of skittles?

P.P.S.

I don't think any Democratic Party POTUS can do anything with the Republican Party in control of congress.  Neither Hillary or Bernie can get progressive and much needed reforms made.  Control of congress must change too and that is unlikely.  But the people need someone from the Democratic Party on the Oval Office as self-defense against the crazy extremists that have gutted the Republican Party of any moderates.  Too many SCOTUS seats to fill and we need an active veto pen.

Ideally we unseat the GOP from power too. Then we can make progress as a people.  But I believe we are mostly in self-defense mode until money is taken out of politics and larger reforms are made that ensure that elections really do matter."
Valladarex,47,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"As a libertarian, I hope that Sanders wins the democratic nomination.

I would love to have a president that leads to a less interventionist foreign policy, expanded immigration, decreased drug control, and increased civil liberties. It's also a major plus that he isn't a super corrupt politician bought off by special interests.

Of course, I strongly disagree with him on nearly every economic issue, gun control, and campaign finance reform. I would definitely vote for Rand Paul or Gary Johnson over him. The fact that Sanders is a socialist means Paul would have an easier time winning as well, since the vast majority of people in this country are not socialist. 

Nonetheless, Sanders is going to make the democratic primaries much more interesting, and I'm happy he's in the race. I hope he moves the party towards the policies that I support him on. "
Fapsington,16,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,Why do you disagree with campaign finance reform? 
Valladarex,7,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Okay, I'll answer the question but I hope people aren't going to make my comment into a campaign finance reform debate. The original intention of my comment is that I have significantly different views on some issues with Sanders, but he's still better than Clinton. 

The reason I disagree with regulating how people can spend their money to further a political cause is because it is infringing on the 1st amendment right to free speech.

I think people should be able to spend their money on what ever they like so long as they are not infringing on the rights of others or putting others at a very high level of risk (such as paying a burglar or buying a bomb). 

People being free to spend their money on political activism is very important in a free society. Giving the government the right to limit this means they would be able to control how much people can spend. That power allows government officials to employ arbitrary limits, which is very dangerous.

Politicians would be able to limit campaign contributions in a way that could help expand their own political interests. The limits and regulations could lead to incumbents gaining more control as challengers may not be able to get enough funding to overcome the incumbency advantage. Limiting campaign contributions would lead to inequalities in the capacity of many political interests to raise money for their campaigns. 

I would rather deal with the consequences of having a large degree of freedom than deal with the consequences of having too little. 

If there's any reform that I would support, it would be for 100% transparency of campaign contributions. 

I expect that most people here will dislike my opinions and that's okay. I was asked what I believe, and this is my answer.

Edit: spelling/grammar fixes"

Fapsington,10,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Thanks for a normal reply. I took the time to write down what I disagreed with if you're inclined. 

&gt;People being free to spend their money on political activism is very important in a free society. 

Agreed, but not by lobbying politicians. Groups can meet, raise awareness, and protest with their money, but buying politicians is completely different.

&gt;Giving the government the right to limit this means they would be able to control how much people can spend, and that power allows government officials to employ arbitrary limits, and that is very dangerous.

How so? Campaigns would only have a set limit for everyone. It wouldn't be a wildly fluctuating number between different politicians. 

&gt;Politicians could limit contributions to certain limits which could help expand their own political interests. 

What? 

&gt;The limits and regulations could lead to incumbents gaining more control as challengers may not be able to get enough funding to overcome the incumbency advantage. 

No, that's literally what's happening now and why we need campaign finance reform. There is no more little guy or grassroots candidate. In order to play you have to raise a LOT of money.

&gt;Limiting campaign contributions would lead to inequalities in the capacity of many political interests to raise money for their campaigns. 

No, that's exactly why we need campaign finance reform. There is no choice or political interests of the people being represented. We need to get the big money out of politics so that the people's concerns are addressed as well as giant corporations/super wealthy people.

&gt;I would rather deal with the consequences of having a large degree of freedom than deal with the consequences of having too little. 

Buying politicians has nothing to do with freedom and everything to do with a corrupt, broken system. Nobody thinks the government is as effective as it should be except for people wanting it to fail. The system we have now is a failing system.

Janube,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"http://www.socialistalternative.org/2014/01/28/polls-u-s-public-opinion/

(Not OP) - ""Love socialism"" is probably strong, but polls consistently show that the majority of people in America, on average, support socialist-leaning policies and ideas.

Socialism is *very* beneficial to your average citizen and people understand that at the micro level. They understand the roads they drive on should be made well, that healthcare should be affordable and handled without profit in mind. They understand schools should be the backbone of our country and that businesses need regulation.

Citizens are *very* socialist, but few of them study political philosophy, so they take what they hear for granted. What they hear about ""socialism"" is bad, even though they like individual socialist-leaning policies.

[Seen here](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/27/poll-obamacare-vs-affordable-care-act/), the way we talk about things changes our opinion of them regardless of the actual facts."

Now, on paper, I would say I agree with many of his stances. However, I don't really think he's such an effective debater. 

In a debate with Michelle Bachmann, which was purported as something of an evisceration of Bachmann, he came off as closer to a rambler. Bachmann was able to make her points more concisely, and he had to concede a bit when he tried comparing our education/healthcare spending to Norway's, and Denmark's. This gave Bachmann the opportunity to point out that those countries are able to exploit their natural resources. What could Sanders say to that? 

I wish Sanders would've painted a more elegant or logical picture about the diminishing returns associated with tax cuts for the wealthy, instead of repeating how well billionaires are doing compared to the poor.

JPOnion,6,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I like this guy and agree with pretty much everything he stands for.  That said, I can't believe there are so many people on reddit that actually think he has a chance.  He doesn't.  He's in it to steer the direction of the debate, that's it, and if he has any *serious* dreams of being President then he's too delusional to be qualified.

He's got my vote in the primaries.  If he gets the actual nomination, well, he's still got my vote but at that point the GOP has won.

EDIT: I'd live to be proven wrong.  Does anyone here actually have some legit reasons they think a Jewish-possibly-atheist, openly-socialist, far-left-leaning candidate has even a remote chance of winning both the primaries *and* the national election in the current political climate?"
WardenOfTheGrey,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt; That said, I can't believe there are so many people on reddit that actually think he has a chance.

If you want him to be elected, publicizing defeatism is the worst thing you could possibly do.

That being said, I will be frank for a second.  I don't honestly think he'll win.  I will donate to his campaign,  I will spread the word, if I can I will volunteer for his campaign, and I will *absolutely* be voting for him.  But still, you're probably right and he probably won't win.  But I want to get his numbers as high as possible.  Because having a real progressive run and play a role in a US presidential election would be huge and even if he does not win would have the possibility of shifting the US political climate farther left than it is now.

Clinton isn't the best candidate.  She'll do a lot of shit I won't agree with.  However she's much, much better than anyone that would realistically win the GOP primary and she *can* win.

PakPak96,11,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"No one is probably going to see this, but regardless:

As good of a candidate he is, Bernie Sanders will not win. His socialism will scare away conservatives and moderate democrats. 
But you know who is a good choice for president?
Jim Webb. 
Jim Webb is the (potential) candidate that you love but have never heard of. Let's start with his ethos and which votes he will attract.

Jim Webb is a Democrat senator from the state of  Virginia, and the former secretary of the Navy. He's extremely centrist. Already that has the attention of moderate Democrats who were scared away from Hillary and moderate Republicans who were scared away from Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. So that is the moderate vote. 

Also, this guy is a war hero from Vietnam. Two Purple Hearts, the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, and the Bronze Star. He has voted to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell, and he helped form the largest expansion to the GI Bill since it was created. He voted in favor of limiting service terms to 12 months for soldiers. So that must mean he's a War Hawk, right? **No**, Jim Webb fiercely opposed the Iraq War, (unlike Hillary, might I add) and has acknowledged that among other things, the War in Iraq has led to sectarian violence in the Middle East (Oct 2014), that the Iraq War created more terrorists than it destroyed, and that there would always be violence in the region as long as US troops were deployed there. (September 2006).

Remember the conservative support I said he would receive earlier? There's another reason for it besides for him being moderate. Jim Webb was the Secretary of the Navy under **Ronald Reagan**, and Reagan even praised Webb in his speeches. Webb left the administration in protest of cuts to the Navy budget. Now here's the part that Reddit may not like about Jim Webb, but it's the party that will solidify the moderate Republican vote: He is tough on immigration and pro-guns. For those of you who think it's bad remember that these are tickets to key Republican votes and states. Just because Webb is conservative on those issues doesn't mean he's unsuitable for Reddit. Take a look at his track record for social reform.

He's opposed to constitutional bans on gay marriage, and thinks that marriage equality is good for the nation, and he was against Don't Ask Don't Tell, and he is against employment discrimination of gays. There's the gay vote for him. (Let's not forget that Hillary used to be against gay marriage).

He is **very** pro-choice. He supports Roe v. Wade, and voted NO on laws that prohibited minors from crossing state lines for abortions, barring grants for organizations that perform abortions, and he is in support of expanding research to embryonic stem cell lines. That's the women's vote.

Jim Webb sees No Child Left Behind as a failure, and acknowledges that there have to reforms to the education , and has voted for more funding for public education.

Webb is great for the environment. He has voted in favor for expanding Cash for Clunkers, and in favor of reducing traffic congestion. He voted against barring the EPA from regulating Greenhouse gasses. He's voted for protecting the middle class from Energy taxes. He is in favor of removing Oil and gas subsidies, and in favor of incentives for more conservation. If you're an environmentalist, this guy is your vote. 

He is in favor of expanding Social Security, so that's gonna win the favor of elderly voters.



There is so much more to Jim Webb than what I can explain here, even though no one is going to see this comment. 

**tl;dr: Jim Webb not only has good policies, but he is attractive to many major demographics**

So please, put your vote behind a man who not only has policies that **you** can agree with, but when you vote for him, that vote won't be wasted.

Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Well, based on his prior voting history, it seems that he goes against many American core economic and government values. I agree with him socially (with the exception of affirmative action and gun control), but he is clearly in favor of widespread government control, massive increases in government spending, increased federal influence in the private sector, and taking away gun rights from the American citizens. I think the term ""communist"" is reaching a bit, but ""very progressive socialist""? Absolutely. I wouldn't vote for him, but that's just my opinion. "
guy_in_the_sky,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"This is GREAT news for republicans! Instead of Hillary coasting through the primaries, she is now going to have to contend with some actual competition. Whether or not Sanders poses a serious threat to Clinton's democratic nomination is up for debate. But the fact that she has some legitimate competition from the far left is going to force her to sell herself to the liberal democratic base. Whereas, she could have kept up her moderate image, which wins general elections, she is now going to have to appear more liberal during primary season, and that is going to hurt her in the general election, if she is in fact the democratic nominee. As a republican, I couldn't be more excited about this announcement. "
not_a_single_eff,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Q: Why are you a Republican? I don't know many so I just thought I'd ask. Both parties seem locked-in to serving Wall Street and big business at large, but Republicans even more so, but with a Christian/Crusade pt 2 bent. 

Why be excited about that party? I don't find any reason to care for either of them, but I'm still curious what anyone who isn't super-rich or just really racist against Muslims and/or dismissive of global history finds to love about them in particular. Is it just a football-type thing (ie: They're not Democrats!)?

Again, being entirely serious. "
guy_in_the_sky,3,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"First of all, thank you for the thoughtful question and for not immediately calling me a douchebag for being a republican. The way you described stereotypical republicans is just that, a stereotype. It's a common misconception that republicans are old, rich, extremely religious, hating Muslims, or any combination of the above.

The truth is, I'm a 32 year old man, from a lower middle class family. I grew up Catholic, but I'm not crazy religious or anything. In fact, I'm more socially moderate than anything. I'm for gay marriage but against abortion. I won't elaborate on my stances because that's not what you asked.

I am republican for a few reasons. The first is because because I agree more with their stance in relation to the role of the government. I think the government should play as small a part in our lives as possible. The government should provide security and protect our borders from foreign threats. It should also be there to help the people who cannot help themselves, those who are unable to provide for themselves and their families because of medical conditions or other reasons that keep people from legitimately being able to provide. But I feel like entitlement programs have gotten entirely out of control and are badly hurting our country financially because too many people get too much government assistance. No one wants to see people living in poverty. Entitlement programs (social security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment, food stamps, etc...) help the poor but they don't get to the root of the problem. They don't provide a means to get people to stop relying on the government to live. I believe that money would be better spent investing in American business to create new jobs and get the poor back working and off of government assistance. Any social program we have should be aimed at getting people out of poverty. The problem is, any money going away from the poor and into business or any tax breaks given to businesses, democrats will usually cry foul, citing the ""trickle-down"" effect, and claiming it does not work. They will say the rich get richer, which brings me to my next reason why I'm republican. 

I don't believe the burden of supporting government run programs should fall on the backs of wealthy Americans. One of the common things you hear is that the rich need to pay their ""fair share."" What most people don't realize is that the top 10% of income earners in the US pay about 70% of the income taxes. The bottom 50% pay about 3% of the total income tax in the country. Yet, most democrats will tell you that the rich don't pay enough. I think, as a country, we spend too much, and taxing the rich to pay for it is completely unacceptable. And just to note, I'm not rich. As I mentioned, I grew up in a lower middle class family. I went to college and paid for it with student loans, which I'm still paying back. I spent most of my 20's working entry level jobs, sometimes two jobs at once, making ends meet, working my way up the ladder in my career, which brings me to my next point.

It appalls me that minimum wage workers feel they should be making $15/hour. When I graduated college, I started my first full time job at $8/hour, which was not enough. So you know what I did? I got a second job waiting tables in the evening to make ends meet. When I started making more money with my full time job, I kept the second job so I could put some money aside and also have some semblance of a social life. I didn't have many luxuries. I didn't make $15/hour until five years after college graduation. For someone to think they deserve that for doing a minimum wage job is disheartening. Nowhere in this country is it guaranteed that if you put in a 40 hour work week, you deserve enough money to live comfortably. If you have minimum experience, minimum education, minimum motivation to improve your situation, and your job requires a minimum amount of skill that could be performed by anybody, then you deserve the absolute minimum pay. I have a good job now that pays very well, but it took ten years of grinding it out, not living very comfortably, to get to this point. I have a good life and live comfortably now. I bought a house and invest my extra income (Quick note: This goes back to my earlier point that the wealthy shouldn't have to pay more in taxes to support the poor. I will be rich someday. I'm not now and I'm not close. But I am smart with my money and I invest rather than spend. I've never had a nice car. Instead, I have a rental property that provides positive cash flow. I will retire before the normal retirement age. From where I came from and the sacrifices I have made and will make in the future, it would not be fair to say that I should have to pay more when I am eventually wealthy. I will someday be among the top 10% in the country, and I don't think it would then be right to ask me to pay more in taxes to support the people who haven't made the same sacrifices or have worked as hard as I will have worked to get to that point. That's all, rant over.). Everything I have now, I worked my ass off for, and I feel like no one is promised anything in this life. You can either sit around complaining about the government and your lot in life, or you can go out and make things happen for yourself because no one is going to give you anything in life. Unfortunately, a lot of people who align with the Democratic Party believe that everyone is entitled to a comfortable life, even if they don't necessarily deserve it.

Some other (smaller) issues that make me align with the Republican Party are gun control, immigration, healthcare, energy, anti-special interest groups, anti-union, and a progressive outlook on race and affirmative action. Just a real quick note on each of these... I believe increased gun control is a waste of government time and resources. The bad guys will always have access to guns illegally. Gun control laws just keep firearms away from normal Americans and/or make them more difficult to get. I believe everyone should have to come to this country legally. It's unfair to those people who did it legally to grant amnesty to those who did not. Plus, illegal immigrants are a drain on our resources, and hard working Americans should not have to pay for that. The new healthcare law is incredibly unfair and, again, puts the burden of supporting the poor on the backs of the rich and the middle class. Quick note, my company-provided insurance premiums doubled when Obamacare was implemented and my parents' (also not rich) deductible went from $1000 to $6000, which is ridiculous. I think we should be actively pursuing means for renewable energy. However, until that becomes a reality, we still need to rely on fossil fuels. Projects like the recently vetoed Keystone Pipeline would make that less expensive. I do think climate change is real and man made, and we need to work to change that. But it doesn't mean we are going to quit using oil and coal overnight. I believe special interest groups are a hindrance to real governmental progress and that our legislators should answer to the people and not those aforementioned special interest groups. I think unions were instrumental in creating many of the labor laws that make working in our country safe and fair. However, I believe they have outlived their usefulness and that unions today simply drive up the price of doing business. Finally, I think that, even though there are still a lot of race issues in our country today, we have indeed come a long way to reducing discrimination in certain aspects. Race should not be an issue in college admissions and other places in which affirmative action gives people opportunities based on the color of their skin. 

Anyways, I know this was a long-winded response, but there really is no way to answer your question in a more succinct manner, and still provide thoughtful reasoning to these points. I hope you understand more now the reasons I align with the Republican Party and that I've been able to change some of the misconceptions you may have had previously."

Enjoy."
treetop82,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Wow just lost any respect for Bernie Sanders, couldn't debate Paul on the issue and just resorted to sarcastic snide pointless questions."
metalface187,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"He pointed out how insane paul's view is.  There was nothing to debate, paul was wrong, you got the answers from the mouths of real doctors, next question. "
treetop82,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It's not insane, it's a little ahead of its time. We haven't got to the point of the government forcing doctors to work for free.

But if you think his idea is far fetched, today police can seize any cash you carry over $10,000 without probable cause. The government can seize your property through eminent domain, sending police if you resist. The government can force you to make a cake for a gay couple or shut your business down and fine you. They can kick down your door if you don't pay your taxes.

What is to say that government passes a law stating that doctors may only work legally if they also accept Medicaid. It's not far fetched at all. "
metalface187,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I see what you are saying but still think it is a far stretch. Doctors will not be forced into slavery. I can see them doing it in isolated cases (normal law abusing stuff) but not on a national scale where a law was made where all doctors are forced to be slaves.  You can say it about any job; create a hypothetical situation then justify it based on a completely different law where the government has power over an individual or business to scare people.

I think we all agree that Asset Forfeiture and Civil Forfeiture are being abused and need a serious rewrite, like many other laws. I think this is a problem with our government reacting too slow and/or bribery.

Healthcare for everyone is important, we are a 1st world country after all. Insurance companies can (and do) raise costs that leave people without insurance, Medicaid fills that gap.  Blame the rising costs of private insurance for the expansion of Medicaid. Blame the terrible trade agreements, loss of manufacturing jobs to China and the higher costs of living on the expansion and usage of social programs.

A business is a business, not a religion. If you want to spread your beliefs, go start a church. If you want to open a business, you serve everyone. Choosing who you serve and not serve is called discrimination and that is a bad thing.  You can cater your business to a group and they will likely come, but if someone outside of your desired group comes, you have to serve them.  It is just basic human decency and common sense. A business should be punished for discriminating. We are trying to move the human race forwards, not backwards."

thingscouldbeworse,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"He's honestly not really any more extreme than Obama ran as. Most of us who voted for Obama in '08 were hoping for a much more liberal president than we got, and in the end he ended up pissing so many people off because he wasn't liberal enough for the liberals and wasn't white enough for the conservatives. If Bernie can deliver on half of what Obama promised, he'll get just as many people voting for him."
Hillary-For-Prez,9,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"First of all, I'm glad he's running, it's important to have a counter to Clinton so she at least spends some time trying to win over liberals.

However, I'd merely ask /r/politics to think for a moment, who is more likely to win the general election? If you come to the obvious conclusion that in fact Hillary is the candidate overwhelmingly more likely to win the general election (as all polling data would indicate), you have to ask yourself a question.

Who would you rather have? A moderate Democrat in the White House in 2016 or a liberal icon turned failed Democratic nominee (along with a Republican in the White House in 2016).

The presidency is a zero sum game, either we win or the Republican's win. And, just as a reminder, the next president is likely to determine the political leaning of the Supreme Court for the next two decades. 

Bernie Sanders is a great senator and will make a great candidate, I just worry that he may come across as the liberal mirror to Ted Cruz or Rick Santorum and that a self described ""socialist"" won't test well with the moderates we need to win the general election. "
RollerRagerMD,4,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I think if Sanders can effectively get his message out then he'd stand a good chance in the general election. Surely people would rather vote for the guy who seems to *honestly care for the common man* over the guy who doesn't. 

And if they don't... oh well. "
Hillary-For-Prez,6,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"&gt; And if they don't... oh well.

The average voter can't seem to listen for more than about 10 seconds. And the unfortunate thing is that these living in Ohio, Florida, and a few other states get to determine who gets to be President. As much as we would like to write them off, we can't.

The unfortunate fact is that older voters in the midwest and south are NOT going to vote for a guy who can very justifiably be described as a ""socialist"", because guess what, that's what he calls himself. I would be very happy with Sanders as President, but I would be very unhappy with him as the democratic nominee - he can't possibly win against a moderate Republican. "
RollerRagerMD,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Perhaps. I don't know man. My conscience tells me to stick to my guns.

dezakin,3,U.S. Sen.

There's almost nothing that could get them to vote for a Republican unless Rand started to sound a whole lot more like his dad. Bernie can get these people. Partisans are already camped out, and really there's nothing on the issues that would make even moderate Democrats stay home.

Really, you only have to look back to 2008. Obama didn't come off as a moderate, even though he governed like one after getting in office. Bernie can easily win the election."
Hillary-For-Prez,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Those ""reserve"" voters are DWARFED by the 10% of the country that actually vote every election and are undecided fucks. These people WILL. NOT. VOTE. FOR. A. SOCIALIST. They're old and lived through the cold war and deep down think of Socialists as the enemy. As well as Sanders polls on Reddit is how badly he polls in a state like Ohio.

Obama won largely because almost every independent voter voted for him, he had record black turnout (both in terms of absolute number and percentage), and yes, had a record ""youth"" turnout. 

I wish Sanders were just a little more moderate and hadn't said things like ""I'm a socialist"", but sadly I just honestly think any appreciable number of independents, the people who *actually* vote, will vote for him. "

Hillary-For-Prez,6,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It should ABSOLUTELY be a reason to vote for someone.

To each his/her own I suppose."
senorrhythm,0,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Then you'll be voting like a sheep (and I don't use that term often at all). Voting for someone because they are stronger rather than because you agree with them on the issues? Not only is that morally weak, it builds a future of automaton presidents. 

Besides, it's way too early to tell how much of a chance Bernie really has. This is what the primaries are for."
Hillary-For-Prez,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Calling someone a sheep is easy. The interesting this is that it doesn't really apply here. I've stated very clearly why I support Hillary, it's because I think she has the best chance of winning. That's distinguishable from a ""sheep"" (someone who just follows the pack). I'm not following the pack, I'm using statistics to help ensure that my ideology is most likely to prevail. That's called pragmatism. 

You shouldn't ""put down"" someone for thinking though things pragmatically. We need to actually win elections, not just support people on the ideological extremes. While you may throw around the word ""sheep"" to describe me, I think the correct way to describe you is a person who's ""ignorant of the world he/she lives in"". 

You're right that there's not a lot of good polling data on Sanders yet, but I can tell you he's not going to win, want to know why? Because the following statement is factually accurate: 

&gt; Bernie Sanders is a 73-year-old Jewish Socialist from Vermont

No one from the center is ever going to vote for that guy and the polling data that comes out over the next few months will confirm this. Oh and the primaries don't do shit for helping figure out how someone will fair during the general election. Fucking Rick Santorm and a guy who makes Pizzas for a living were winning the Republican primary at one point and neither of those guys was the least bit electable.

Polling data of likely voters is the only sure way to predict what chance a candidate has."
senorrhythm,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"So you're saying I shouldn't vote for Bernie Sanders because he's Jewish? And old? And a socialist? 

Or are you saying I should vote based on popularity? 

If you vote for someone because they are popular, I think that gives me the right to call you a sheep. Think about it. "
Hillary-For-Prez,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I'm not voting for him because everyone else is, I'm voting for her because polling data indicates she will win. I am a single issue voter and my ""issue"" is SCOTUS nominees.

In to the current political climate, literally any politicized bill will get challenged in the Judiciary. It wouldn't matter if the Dems had a filibuster proof majority in the House and Senate and had the white house if the Supreme Court is Conservative and knocks down literally ever piece of liberal legislation.

Abortion is legal because Kennedy believes in *stare decisis* (see Planned Parenthood v. Casey - a 5-4 decision),  campaign finance is dead (Citizen's United - a 5-4 decision), Obamacare is only legal (for now) because Roberts had a last second change of heart (Sebelius - a 5-4 decision), etc... the list goes on and on. 3+ of the Justices are probably dead in 8 years so whoever is elected president is probably going to determine whether this country makes any meaningful progress. You don't need a ""liberal giant"" to get a liberal Court either. RBG, the most liberal Justice the Court has ever had, was appointed by Bill Clinton, who, guess what, is more conservative than his wife.

If you think now is the time to try to fuck up the country for the next two decades + because you thought ""we should try to get a fucking socialist elected president"", you're the most fucking ignorant person in the fucking world. 

#People like you are the guys who voted for fucking Ralph Nader in 2000 and got us in this fucking problem in the first place by voting ""ideologically"" instead of ""pragmatically"". 

#You are the kind of person who makes this country worse by not seeing the world for what it is and just hoping things will work out. 

#Grow up."
senorrhythm,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Thanks for the shouting and stuff. /s

Ralph Nader wasn't the problem. Corruption/voter fraud in the Florida electoral college (and Jeb Bush) was the problem. Or, you could argue that Ralph Nader was the problem too. Either way, I am not willing to compromise for a country that only chooses between two candidates. We need to be open to other voices. Otherwise it's going to be an election between a turd and a shit sandwich (or however the South Park episode goes) every year. That's not real democracy. "
senorrhythm,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Oh by the way, you can't really compare Bernie to Nader because Bernie is running as a Democrat, against Hillary in the primaries. So, if he loses, I doubt he would be that annoying third-party candidate that sucks votes from the democratic nominee. "
Hillary-For-Prez,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I agree with what you wrote, I think there's just a disconnect between what I said and what you heard (though it could very well be in how I phrased it).

I am stating that the people who voted for Nader were the ""ideologues"" of the Democratic party who's views perfectly aligned with Nader and so they voted for him. However, their decision to do this was not ""pragmatic"" insofar as there was no chance Nader could win. The most Nader could do was let Bush win, which he did a splendid job at.

So while Sanders' decision to run as a Dem is in no way analogous to Nader's decision to run as an independent, IMO, supporting Sanders will likely have the same effect in the end and for the same reasons - Sanders does not stand much of a chance in the general (for all the reasons you know to be true but hope we can ""change"").

In my mind, this election (and relection assuming a victory in the general), may be one of the most important for the next two decades because of the current ages of Justices on the Court. There are a few really old Justices and a few really young ones. There's a chance we can have the most liberal Court this country has ever seen and use it to push the country forward in a way never seen before. THIS is the most important issue facing America right now IMO and why I care quite a bit about the election. 

That said, thank you for your comment and what you wrote is absolutely correct."
senorrhythm,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I see what you're saying. The court is important, and I'm sure Bernie would appoint great people, too. 

What can I say? I'm a starry-eyed idealogue. And I'm not the only one. It's in my personality not to compromise in the way you see as pragmatic. 

If Hillary wins the primary, and is up against a run-of-the-mill republican, you bet I'd vote for her. But in the meantime, it looks like we can have someone better. 

I understand that Hillary is more centrist and thus may garner more republican votes in the general, but maybe Bernie will appeal to the working man, regardless of party line. 

Either way, I'll be starry-eyed until I'm slapped silly. "

idrinkandigotobed,3,U.S. Sen.

He has a tiny, *tiny* chance of winning the Democratic nomination.  However small his chance of winning the nomination is, he has an infinitely smaller chance of winning the general election.  Any seasoned political scientist will tell you, with unwavering certainty, that Bernie Sanders will lose in 2016.  His electoral appeal does not extend beyond young people.  And even if every single young person voted for Sanders (not gonna happen), young people only accounted for 19% of the vote in 2012.  Sanders 2016 is a pipe dream.

This doesn't mean his entry into the race is totally futile.  Perhaps he'll nudge Hillary to the left on some issues.  At the very least maybe he can make other liberal issues more salient to the American people.  Good can and will come of his candidacy.  But let's be clear:  he has no chance of winning."

But we have a serious opportunity to change the course of this country by shifting the balance of the court, and overturning Citizens United.

I also have plenty of legitimate complaints with his economic policies and their legitimacy, along with his foreign policies.

He brings attention to some very important issues in our time. BUT, his stances on those which concern me are so far out there that I could NEVER dream of voting for him.  "
Bokonomy,8,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"It must nice to have enough wealth to not care about others. I think even if I start making a good amount of money, at long as the candidate isn't telling me that more than half of my wages are going to be taxed, I'll be cool with it. "

I would because I believe that as long as I comfortable, equality trumps just about everything else. And if you're making over 100k, you're doing fine. I'm a first-generation college kid, so I know you can live off less and be happy. I truly believe that money isn't everything after you've reached a certain threshold. 

Besides, an educated country benefits everyone. It means less crime overall, and wouldn't you like to walk safer streets? "

As the old saying goes, follow the money, Sanders takes money from labor based organizations and small donations. I would trust labor money, that has the interest of the working class in mind, more than big business that exploits its workers. 

If we want the middle class and working class to take back some of their share, Sanders would be the first step. "

Those saying Texas will be blue in 2020 I want whatever you are smoking. The electoral system is based on winning states getting 49.99% in Texas gets you zero electoral votes. The elections always come down to independents and swing states. I actually think Bernie is a better national candidates because I think independent will see him as one of their own and the dems would vote for him to vote against the republicans. Can you imagine an America with a republican supermajority, Supreme Court and president? That should scare everyone.

you'd have to look into how your state works. googling up where nevada is on the calendar, it appears that you guys are very early in the campaign season (and actually vote before super tuesday) so bernie won't have dropped out yet by that point.

reaper527,1,U.S. Sen.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/02/18/cbo-minimum-wage-jobs/5582779/

there is definitely a pattern in that report of higher minimum wage means more job loss. you can extrapolate that to $15/hr as you see fit."

But, I refuse to vote for any candidate that doesn't have election reform as a central part of their platform, as I believe real change begins with a review of the process of how we choose our leaders.

Even if you don't agree with him, respect the fact that he has the balls to speak his mind, call out the BS, and get reelected over and over.  I would rather have him over Hillary any day.  If we are just going to elect Hillary because she's a woman, then let Elizabeth Warren run.  Heck, just paying to see Warren and Cruz debate issues longform would be worth 20 bucks"

&gt;His brother, Larry Sanders, was a Green Party County Councillor representing the East Oxford division on Oxfordshire County Council, in England, until his retirement in 2013. He is running as a Green Party candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon in the 2015 United Kingdom elections.[77][78][79]"
Eloquai,1,U.S. Sen.

I was elected to the County Council in 2005 and re-elected in 2009. I was the Leader of the Green Group from 2005 to 2013. 

I don;t like the Greens (UK) some of their policies are just nuts and completely impracticable e.g. ""Everybody in the world can move to Britain"" (one of the world's most densely crowded countries) and the virtual banning of privately owned cars.  I also don't live in his constituency but I do (from what I have seen) like Bernie Sanders and would like to vote for him or even his brother."

bernie is an independent. the fact that he caucuses with democrats in the senate doesn't negate that.

ron paul is a republican. the fact that his policies are libertarian is completely separate from his voter registration.

reaper527,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"it's blatantly obvious that cup was implying that bernie being an independent would raise issues with eligibility for the democratic nominee.

you dismissed this, and then proceed use ron paul and liberman as examples, which as i pointed out are terrible and unrelated comparisons to bernie. with bernie, you actually have an issue of party affiliation where as with the other 2 you don't. paul was clearly registered a republican and liberman was clearly registered democrat (prior to being forced out).

there is nothing in common whatsoever between bernie's situation and either of theirs. you tried to create this false equivalency between caucusing and party registration, but at the end of the day they are very different things."

uglyinchworm,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"For everyone who is convinced that the American people are salivating at the chance to elect the first self-proclaimed socialist to the White House, you should probably review this Gallup polling data: http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx

At this point, only 24% of Americans even consider themselves to be *liberals*, let alone socialists. A full 38% of Americans identify as conservatives and 34% see themselves as moderate. Bernie Sanders is certainly not conservative or moderate -- if he was, no one in r/politics would be excited about him.

Those are the odds he would face in winning the presidency, with 72% of the country already seeing themselves as nowhere near as liberal as he is. Remember, Obama openly ran away from the term ""socialist"" and presented himself as a centrist. Sanders will proudly represent the left-wing of American politics and all of the connotations that come along with it. Whether or not he actually is a socialist is irrelevant; American voters aren't interested in nuance and many -- even moderate Democrats -- still equate being a socialist with being ""un-American."" Perceptions matter, and Sanders is going to have a hard time convincing enough people outside of college campuses and r/politics that they should vote for an almost 75-year-old ""socialist."""

He is more in the middle when it comes to guns. Probably one of the more open Democrats when it comes to that.

Is that stance really going to stop you from voting for him, especially if you agree with the 12 Step Plan (I don't know if you do, but is it really worth it to have a Republican who could screw the economy up again or Clinton who is more anti-gun, which seems to be the most important issue for you)"

chillbroswagginzz,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"He ""decided"" there's no good reason to have a standard capacity magazine - **for us** - *He* and his friends and family are constantly surrounded by magazines with more than 10 rounds. One law for the rich, and another for everyone else. I'd like to see his credentials/experience that allowed him to ""decide"" that people require 10 rounds to defend themselves and their families but 11 is unnecessary and dangerous. Clearly he has no knowledge re: the defensive use of firearms, but it doesn't stop him from knee-jerk party line voting in a way that puts real people in danger. And I'm not even a ""gun nut"" - as far as I can tell I'm part of the near-silent majority. This vote is a barometer for me. I'm pro liberty, and would say the same thing if he voted NO on gay marriage, for example. Mag-limit bans is of those things that quickly lets me know this person does not represent me."
MisterForkbeard,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"That's fair. I don't agree with your reasoning or your litmus test, but if that's the issue you care about, then that's the issue you care about. :)

To my mind, I can't really think of a situation where a real/legitimate use of a firearm would require more than 10 rounds. But that's just me, and I've never had to use one defensively."
chillbroswagginzz,2,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"I've never voted D or R b/c I can't vote for the morality based legislation of the R's or the nanny-state mentality of the D's. And I know the chances are very slim I'll ever need a gun, let alone more than 10 rounds - but you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who has ever survived a defensive situation who said ""I wish I had less ammo."" Just taking from this weeks news, if I were in my home or office in a riot situation, I'll take every advantage I can get to protect my family. Like I said, I know it's a rare situation, but it's just one of those things that when you need it, you need it more than you've ever needed anything. I think of my guns as a one time payment insurance policy that I'll hopefully never need."
MisterForkbeard,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Fair enough. My take on it was that having a small magazine was an acceptable compromise - I can still carry as much ammo as I might need, I'd just need to reload slightly more often.

And I think the idea for the magazine limit was that it wouldn't be possible to lay down a hail of gunfire (in one of those ""crazed gunman"" situations or more mundane crimes) without having to stop after a short interval to reload. It limits the immediate destruction and gives others time to get away or try to stop the gunman, I guess. Not sure how likely that actually is, but it seemed reasonable and the 10-round-per-mag limit didn't seem to be a significant burden on gun ownership.

But clearly, I'm not the type of person that cares too much about it one way or the other. But thank you for the conversation - it's always interesting to learn another viewpoint, especially someone with more experience in that area than I have.  Have an upvote. :)"

At the same time, it is quite clear that Bernie Sanders' political leanings are in a complete disconnect with the average American.  He voted against banning partial birth abortions multiple times.  This puts him far out of touch at a time when Cory Gardner can win as a Republican in Colorado in part due to Udall's extreme abortion stance.  Opposing the Trans Pacific Partnership, however justified, is not something that will appeal to the average voter who will only see it as opposition to a free trade agreement.  Most of his political tenets are economically dangerous at a time when Americans are increasingly worried about the global economy.

This makes no sense. If the government wanted to erode your other freedoms, owning a gun is not going to stop them. Your neighborhood militia isn't going to do much good against drone strikes.

People don't use guns to protect their freedoms, they use them to kill each other, and [overwhelmingly themselves](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/).

&gt; Bringing up suicide is laughable to me people are going to do it one way or the other

You're actually wrong on this. Suicide is an impulsive act, the overwhelming majority of people who attempt suicide and live are happy that they did, and do not attempt it again. This is why they're finally building a fence on the Golden Gate Bridge, if it's harder to kill yourself you're less likely to do it. We should all care about this, suicides have a hugely negative societal effect.

Killing yourself with a gun is far easier than killing yourself by other means, and that goes for violence against others as well. It seems childish to insist that if there were less guns on the streets the overall level of violence, self-inflicted or otherwise, would be the same. You can't massacre twenty kids in a school with a knife.

Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"The point is that law abiding citizens become non-law abiding citizens at some point. The question is, whether they have a gun when they start breaking the law, or whether they have a knife.

Guns are dangerous tools. A law-abiding husband discovers his wife is cheating on him. In the heat of the moment, it is easier to pull a trigger than plunge a knife."
cubanb407,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,What about that same wife locked in a bedroom while some armed asshole is committing a b&amp;e and hasn't been laid in a while...  everyone deserves their own protection imo. Save ppl do not shoot unless warranted. 
forwhateveritsworth4,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"So now your argument isn't about govt tyranny but about personal safety? Surely tasers or pepper-spray type self-defense exists too ya know.

Or, ya know, having a shotgun instead of a handgun.

I'm not opposed to people having guns, in 100% of situations. And I highly doubt Bernie is either. Having some restrictions on types of permitted weapons or about licensing--these are not outrageous."
cubanb407,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,This is an argument? I thought this was a healthy discussion.  Guns serve more then one purpose you know. Someone brought up the point of gun violence and I stated it goes both ways.  I will not vote for someone who wants to regulate gun rights to death. You think Bernie will shoot down this kind of legislation when it's brought up? Fat chance he will endorse it look at his history. 
forwhateveritsworth4,1,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Does he talk about doing that? Do you think that will be a high priority for him? Do you think congress will suddenly stop being pro gun rights? He won't be a tyrant you know.

He will focus on economic issues, and if gun control comes up, he will support reasonable legislation. I mean, what's his most personally restrictive votes for guns?"

Unfortunately Gun rights is my main concern then I look at who meets most of my beliefs.  It seems I am doomed to deal with ass backwards republican candidates for this very reason.  The one year I vote for Obama I see him try to push major gun control due to sandy as well put restriction on cheap ammo for joe american as well put a restriction on cheap firearms that should be back in the hands of the common man (look up the Korean m1 garand ordeal).  After all of this I will never make the mistake of putting that gun rights on the shelf again.

Point is, who cares? Old people win elections all the time."
StrewwelChris,5,U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders will announce his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday,"Reagan was also likely going senile while in office, and that could put people off. Though I think a senile Sanders would still probably be better than Hillary or Bush."

I can understand the whole ""muh body muh rights"" thing for abortions, but if someone kicks a woman in the stomach, causing her to lose her child, and her and her husband actually WANTED this child, this asshat voted that there should be no additional punishment. If you're going that far just to protect abortion rights, you need to reevaluate your humanity.

You do realize that bills often have completely unrelated things attached to them? This bill could have been 95% sensible shit, and then 5% total shit, and that maybe he voted against it because of the 5% total shit?

I believe there is one state in the Union that hasn't succesfully outlawed bestiality for just this reason. Whenever a bill is introduced to outlaw it, people add pork n shit, and that gets people to vote against it (even though the ""he voted against outlawing bestiality) "

Bernie Sanders is a bat shit insane socialist who panders to the occupy wall st (the occutards) movement.

The stupid and evil parasitic miscreant vote will sweep Hillary Clinton, the criminal queen of the thieving, parasite enabler/nurturer demons into office. Which goes to prove that evil has won (for now). Funny part is, actually winning is WAY more than that. The stupid/crooked don't understand that. Can't wait until all these miscreants are forever out of my eternity.

Getting businesses and corporations out of the government is what the free market is about, along with freely setting prices. Unless he calls for nationalizing industry or giving the capital to a collective of some sort, he's not really socialist. He's also expressed admiration for the Nordic Model, which is a strain of Third Way capitalism. "
